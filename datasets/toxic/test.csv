"In WA, unlike some other states, there is no vetting process for initiatives and referendums. This leads to many initiatives passing a vote and then turning out to be illegal or unconstitutional.  Democracy doesn't mean we can vote to break the law.  The courts decide these questions of law, that's basic poli sci.  They're ones granted that authority.  The City has a duty to challenge actions not permitted by law.  And when we vote to break the law we should expect it to be challenged and overturned. As some of those quoted suggest, we should expect it this time too.",0

"Michael, Alaska has never allowed its citizens to find and sell oil for a profit, do you see a problem with that?  You should ask if you don't know, so let me make it clear for you, I have never asked the state to pay me to develop anything!  Michael where do you get your information, your source caused you to be mistaken? I add $$ to the PF  Understand my right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness should not be taken by people that don't understand we have laws and the interstate commerce Clause is part of those laws. Americans can do do business in all states in the Union, didn't you know!   I love America and my family and many good men and women fought so we can have a nation of brothers that are united, I am proud to be an America.   If you think an Alaskan soldier should care about a fellow soldier from a different state in the union like Florida then we do agree that we are United?  We are brothers and we love America as one nation! Remember who paid for Alaska in 1867,USA!",0

"my2cents - I agree under-reporting is a problem in general, but rapes/assaults definitely happen in villages and are not reported.  I have met many women who were raped while growing up in a village and in all but one case, the crime was never reported.  Again, the distrust of the troopers is a big component of that problem.  It is also embarrassing for many victims to admit they were violated.  Unlike a city where a victim can go to a hospital or police station to report the crime in relative anonymity, women in the villages would have to call for a trooper to fly into the village and a public spectacle is made.",0

"Kendrys Morales is not mediocre.  He has a history of being a productive hitter, repeating 30HR, 100RBI seasons, while playing in ballparks (KC, Anaheim, Seattle) far less forgiving to power hitters than Rogers Center.

Kelly) are saying how the Royals are in trouble without Morales, the cleanup hitter from their World Series winning lineup.  When EE didn't take $20M per year, this became an obvious value play, getting virtually the same production at roughly half the price.

So what would happen and how much time would pass if Obamacare was dropped and people in need of health care had to wait around for Congress to come up with an alternative?

"Bill,  What value could possibly result from such a survey? You've already made it clear that you believe your view is exclusive in being correct so anyone with a different view is a modern-day Korah and not a ""true Adventist."" The differences between such a zealous view and that of radical Islamic terrorists is you claim to be a follower of Jesus and how far you might be willing to go to enforce their eradication. It is the same spirit of intolerance based on disbelief that God can or will do anything other than what you approve. That is NOT the spirit of God.  If I've learned anything in 11 years of gift-based ministry it is to never underestimate God's power to work in surprising ways that bring people into a saving relationship with Him. I've even seen Him use a stopped-up toilet to lead a person to redemption! So the God I serve obviously exists and works outside the limits you claim.",0

The situation has changed, if y'all weren't able to put a little extra away when the going was good thats on you, and you probably shouldn't be involved in the education system anyhow. If the burden keeps getting passed off onto the students, eventually they will go elsewhere for their education and are unlikely to return.

"Ms Kozak...is there info on the track record as far as accuracy is concerned regarding the CBOs analyses?  Did you check OMB?  CBO only provides their data based upon the data they are given.  I think they used Mr Obama's numbers to generate the score for the current initiative.  I could be mistaken, but it wasn't mentioned in your article.  The 22 mil figure is off by about 12 mil because the revised figures denote 10 million.  I guess one needs to remember that the dynamic system that ACA pretty much eliminated was replaced w/ an overreaching static system.  Or at least they tried to.  Good thing people affected by all the cost increases (some states by 400%) got to experience an end result of poor legislation.

"So what this is really telling us is that UH is pretty fiscally responsible, given that Cal athletics outspends its revenue in one year by about the same amount as UH atletics has outspent its revenue over the past 15 years.  The reality is that university athletic programs -- even at the so-called ""power conference"" schools that get paid big TV bucks -- typically outspend their revenue and must be subsidized by the university.  And flagship universities everywhere in the country are willing to pay that subsidy because they understand it's an effective marketing investment.  Successful athletics helps build a school's brand image and increase the enrollment of tuition-paying students, and tuition revenue is a school's financial lifeblood.  Anyone who doubts that athletics helps market a university probably didn't notice that the most-read article in yesterday's online Star-Advertiser was about a UH women's volleyball coach.",0
"Of course, head injuries from riding bikes are greatly reduced by simply wearing a helmet. Falls on bikes are also much less frequent that the repeated impacts that are part of football.

"I've learned over the years (and several inter-provincial moves) that friendships come and go. Too often, we think we're closer than we really are, so it takes more time to grieve the lost friendship than that friendship really deserves.  In addition, many people don't know how to say ""it's over"" in a non-threatening manner, so they simply say nothing, hoping that the other person won't find out they want to move on and forget them.  If a friend doesn't respond to an e-mail or letter, I normally write a second time after a while (to allow for the possibility of a lost message). If that second message is not answered, time to move on.  If it's been a long or close friendship, I'll write a 3rd time just to say farewell, for closure. In that message, I may say that I understand the friendship has run its course and that I won't write again unless I hear otherwise, or I just say ""I appreciated our friendship while it lasted. Best wishes for the future."" That's also good to end it first.",0

"The police have long struggled with their role in society. In  the past we have seen windshield sticker campaigns being banned, and a variety of similar police campaigns eventually being determined to be unsuitable activity for them. Likewise, inserting a paramilitary force into  cultural activities which have had as their impetus for their beginning, to fight against police brutality and degradation, which was both police misconduct but also an attempt by the state to control, diminish and even destroy these groups is  offensive. BLM is right. These groups and the public are heartened that police have taken steps to mend their ways, but paramilitary groups have no official place here.    It is shocking that the media does not understand these basic principles.",0
"In any case, trickle down does work. Even John F. Kennedy believed in trickle down and it has been proven to work every time it has been tried.

There are tax cuts for every income range and the greatest rate of tax cuts are for those in the middle class and poor. Kennedy, Reagan and Bush did it and Trump is proposing the same idea.

"Even an evolutionary view of sex makes it very clear how the anatomy (i.e., and thus the sexes) is/are supposed to be engaged.  Expression of love and fun has no bearing on evolution, except with respect to how love and fun affect survival of the species.  e.g., Sex is fun because it promotes sex and, therefore, procreation; sex establishes bonds between the partners to assure that the offspring have two parents to raise them and thus increase the chance of survival.   I'm not sure given your perspective about homosexuality how you could argue for any sexual boundaries.  Any person that comes up with a good rationalization for a sexual perversion that someone disagrees with is another scapegoat.  Loving God requires paying attention to what God has made very clear what he wants from us; it does not require accounting for what makes us happy or comfortable.",0

Of course, this would have simply supported the weapon manufacturer, not the softball team. Either way, the logic (or lack thereof) is fascinating.  I am thrilled that Rev. Lucas supported the softball team, and look forward to them doing the raffle again next year using the same kind of prize. Perhaps they could do a second raffle for Rev.

"I was a long time subscriber to the Jesuit weekly magazine ""America"".  Father Reese was the Editor for some time.  During his tenure the magazine was a source of scholarly articles by renowned experts.  Father Reese was careful to allow both side of an issue to be discussed.  I waited eagerly each week for something to read that had substance, authority, and interest.  Certainly this kind of broad minded openness could not be permitted while JPII was Pope.  He, after all, is the Pope who forbade further discussion about women as priests.  I do not understand his fear of discussion.  If something is true, it will still be true no matter how much discussion there is.  Because some US Bishops objected to Father Reese's openness, he was removed as Editor.  Subsequent editors failed to continue his approach.  I have  cancelled my subscription as America is now a slick, empty social justice magazine.  Bravo Father Reese!",0

After the summer break there is a high probability that the government will prorogue Parliament, as has been the tradition to do roughly halfway through a 4-year mandate of a majority government for quite some time now.  If they do follow that tradition then this bill will be killed.  Obviously the Liberals aren't forced to prorogue Parliament, but it looks likely that they will. They could also re-introduce this bill if it is killed, but doing so could potentially delay the bill being passed into law by a very long time (maybe a year from now? maybe more?).",0

"I worked with acting-out children and youth for almost 40 years. mostly as a special education teacher. Special programs are expensive. Their effectiveness depends on many variables, not the least of which is the kid's willingness to change. Openness is often a matter of timing: a kid who is defiant and subversive may encounter a 'reality check' that suddenly makes him open to improvement.   It's helpful when kids realize that there is a spectrum of services and facilities for people (both adults and children) who cannot manage in the regular system and that this spectrum involves increased/decreased freedoms. Some kids are determined to test that system so it's important to have effective responses available when & where they are needed.   Everyone loses when an acting-out child is in an ineffective milieu (home, classroom, residential facility). Staff & parents get burnt out, peers are negatively affected and the child/youth's misbehaviour is encouraged, his attitudes harden, etc.",0

But the total direct oil and gas employment in Alaska was 4,700 in 2013.  It is much less, today.  Exxon, Conoco and BP, combined, have about 100 employees state wide according to ABM.    So where is the other $8 billion in costs, you claim?  Its fiction.  The net profits game played here has Big Oil claiming expenses here, that it incurs in other parts of the world.

Did a good job, got decent raises each and every year (say 3%) from raise for inflation.

And I suspect that when mueller goes after trump for treason, I suspect that either pence or ryan will pardon trump before a full conviction can occur. And yes, T will be gone before Xmas. The real question will be, who will replace him. If they go for treason, then Pence will be included, RIGHTLY and ryan will be president.

Congress has been slithering sideways away from this unpleasant task for the last 76 years.   Trump, as very much the non traditionalist, would be well advised to demand that Congress do its duty, if for no other reason than to give the voice of “we the people” its decisive role in the decision making process.

I have never seen any account which suggested Kissinger was a party to something that irresponsible. Nixon's actions resulted in  a sickening number of additional causalities and extended the war by six years. I agree the War became a rallying cry for many cracks in the American society which had lingered for decades. However, I don't believe it was the Vietnam war which caused those cracks. The real problem with American society has always been slavery and the after effects of that social institution. It has never  been constructively resolved and its impact on race relations in America has undermined everything good about that country. The Vietnam era only aggravated the racial divide. I do believe that Vietnam was the cause of the election of Ron Reagan and the rise of the NRA which later evolved into the Tea Party and in 2016, the current administration.",0

Eve took the apple because ""it was pleasing to the eyes"" and she wanted to be ""chic,"" or in Bible words, ""like gods."" Sadly, Adam colluded.

"It's the political economy, buddy. The US purports to be a bastion of independent democracy and prosperity for all, but pursues aggressive  imperialism abroad and virulent racism at home. They've done everything to increase economic inequality at home and abroad.   They supposedly saved the world from tyranny and made the world safe for democracy by winning two world wars, but at least since the end of WWII have become increasingly corporatist and increasingly right wing.    Ideals like the human rights to adequate housing, suitable work, literacy, clean water, in the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1949 have been constantly violated. They gave up the Geneval Convention against torture. They've waged illegal immoral wars in Vietnam and Iraq. They back military torture dictatorships in impoverished countries like Egypt.    The US has lost much of the democracy it had and much of its sovereignty to the world-wide billionaire corporatist oligarchs.   The US is no ""liberal democracy"".",0
No that's not why. It's because the provision of health care for the nation is a massive undertaking and it requires all the options we as a nation can muster. Very few countries have a public only system. universal access to healthcare is essential. That access may be improved by private players entering the market. There are many ways this may occur. It need not change the single payer model or it might. The system right now is overburdened. Personally I believe governments know this and are quietly waiting for private players to come in as a release valve,0

Granted some criticism here is a little blunt but I haven't seen anything particularly off side, politics is a tough game sometimes, regardless of gender.  It's worth considering that many commenters may consider the September threats an entirely separate incident that has either been resolved or is unsubstantiated drama.

Based on my experience, the level of blame you assign to violent video games is inaccurate.  I don't play many games now but I used to. I absolutely loved ""pwnen noobs"" in PVP games. Back in the 90's I had lots of friends that would get together for all night FPS sessions almost weekly. We all had easy access to guns and we even argued on occasion. No one ever resorted to grabbing a gun let alone killing someone. Admittedly, I've lost contact to most of the people in that group over the years but I'm pretty sure none of them are in prison... at least for murder.  IMO there are MANY factors that lead to that level of depravity, video games are just a minor potential contributor.

I think objectively we or a jury can never know the truth in cases like this, the jury will most likely be voting their prejudices and personal world views.  You know a grand jury is a rubber stamp and an indictment via them carries no special validation.  Grand juries approve what 99 +% of indictments sought?

Wal-Mart, for instance, costs you, and all of us taxpayers, because their poverty wages have to  be supplemented by taxpayers shelling out for food stamps and publicly-supported health care.  You say, correctly, "" losses [from the recession] were borne by the middle class while Wall Street took the gains."" Why are you blaming union workers, who have signed contracts that corporations agreed to, when the blame still lies with corporations bleeding taxpayers AND workers for outsized profits?   Clearly, BTW, a **proposed** tax doesn't support anyone. If the tax goes into affect, the state receives the receipts and that money will go into the general fund to be used for education, health care, senior services, and other PUBLIC benefits.",0

"A recent post by a psychiatrist (from another site) comments on just that:  ""...Donald Trump suffers from severe psychopathology, specifically severe narcissistic personality disorder. This is a man for whom the psychic distress caused by feeling in anyway inadequate, less than, or even second best is so profound as to lead him, on a moment by moment basis, to create his own reality to live in in which he is the Best There Ever Was. Most misinterpret Trump's braggadocio as showmanship. It's not. His hyperbole is for him; he can't tolerate the prospect of even the slightest admission of a personal deficiency or area for improvement. Lastly, with respect to his inability to project empathy, it's far more likely that he is incapable of actually feeling empathy. Inability to feel true empathy is often seen in those with severe Cluster B personality pathology. ... he is incapable of appreciating the emotional perspective of anyone else.""",1

The US economy went from shedding 400,000 jobs per month to 81 months of consistent job growth, averaging 125,000 new jobs per month.. The crime rate has in fact, continued falling in the US over the past 8 years. The middle east chaos, which is entirely attributable to George W Bush's idiotic decision to invade Iraq is at least stabilizing with limited US presence.  Donald Trump spent $7 million to save 800 jobs in Indiana a couple of weeks ago. 75,000 Americans lose their jobs each day. Trump's answer to that is to take away healthcare insurance and roll back wages for the poorest Americans while giving massive tax breaks to the richest - himself included.   You do the math",0

"First of all, Kiszla has never liked Siemian.  Secondly, let the cold hard facts of John Elway's stats as a QB speak for themselves.  In his first two seasons - the first just 10 games - Elway completed 337 0f 639 passes for a completion percentage FIFTY THREE PERCENT while throwing 25 TDs and 29 INTs and a 6.5Y/A.   He was less mediocre in season 2, yet the Broncos went 12-2 despite only minimal improvement from Elway from year 1 to year 2.  For his entire career, Elway's stats are:56.9% completions, 7.1Y/A, 300 TDs, 226 INTs, 148-82 won/lost =.643.  Despite a less than mediocre completion % and a plain bad TD/INT ratio - worse, 1.33/1 than Jay Cutler's, 1.43/1 - he is reckoned by many so-called experts to be among the top 5 or 6 QBs of all time.  Why? Because he is a 5 time Super Bowl QB even tho he lost his first 3 and was quite mediocre in his first win.   So just WTF does Siemien's 59%, 7.0Y/A, 18TDs, 10 Ints, while playing with a bad shoulder much of the time get so dissed?",0

"Ah Catholic church censorship ... I remember it well here in Ireland. Gay Byrne , host of the ""Late, Late, Show"" on national tv; was having a lighthearted quiz among couples from the audience. They had separated the individual members of each couple. out of earshot. He asked one man what colour nightie his wife wore on their honeymoon; he replied that it was transparent; she replied that she wasn't wearing any. That was a Saturday night in 1966 .  Next day being Sunday; Bishop Thomas Ryan of Clonfert  (east Galway) denounced the ""Late Late Show"" from the pulpit at Mass and said ""he was disgusted by the disgraceful performance"". The newspapers had a field day. During the 1950's/60's at the height of the ""Showband"" scene & dance halls for young people;  the hierarchy banned dancing during Lent each year across the country. Thousands of musicians were out of work for 46 days; unless they went overseas to entertain Irish communities.  These are just two lighthearted examples.",0

Instead, in regard to health care in Canada, a far too large percentage of the population has taken the view that the system invented 60+ years ago is the only way to do it. Not so. We have issues, and we need fresh thinking to address them. Junior will feel far too threatened  to innovate on his own in this area .  So instead Junior, follow the tried and true Canadian model for dealing with controversy; appoint a blue-ribbon Royal Commission to deal with this.

That was in 325 A.D. - fully three centuries after the Christ with none of the first witnesses still hanging around.  No matter how much you try to suppress the gnostic traditions in Christianity, no one can deny their presence even in the New Testament.

First off since the 1950's with the first refugee convention and subsequent agreements, Canada has agreed that any person who makes it in Canada will have a claim to Convention refugee status adjudicated.

We have passed that exemption into various iterations of our domestic immigration law with the latest being s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  In 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada in the Singh decision confirmed that ""everyone"" PHYSICALLY IN Canada meant exactly that... EVERYONE even those in Canada w/o valid immigration status.

The arguments against the pipeline included constant oil spills due to earthquakes and other acts of nature, disruption to the lives of native populations in Alaska, endangerment of fish, and threats to wildlife, such as caribou, polar bears, and moose.

Attempts at a second agreement failed in 1998.

The NDP government of Mike Harcourt legislated teachers back to work by imposing the contract that gave teachers virtually everything they wanted, including control of class size.  The contract you refer to wasn’t the product of successful bargaining.  The contract was unilaterally, legislatively imposed.

"""Love is a mutual benevolence, mutually known"" (Aristotle, ""Ethics"").

The not subtle, self-serving, scholastic and ecclesial distinctions of eros, agape, etc., are so inadequate, perverse in their intent to indoctrinate, rationalize celibacy, chastity, clerical and ecclesial submission; to denigrate sex. What is fundamental is ""bene-volence""- w-i-l-l-i-n-g the good for other, as active, ""being for"", and intrinsic mutuality.  Reproduction, ""complementarity"" of organs, intercourse, indissolubility, are all subsidiary to the ""mutual benevolence mutually known"". Jesus knew/knows that.

"I agree in principal. And I agree that the leaks relating to the article at hand aren't helpful. But that's on the leaker, not the media.  Now, Russia attempting to influence the presidency and potential coverups do equate to criminal action, and I don't think they hurt us all if they help lead to a clear understanding of exactly where people's priorities lie. It's not fabricated, there was indeed an attempt to influence the election. None of the leaks assume Trump colluded with the Russians but there is a lot of suspicious behavior and the placing it in the public narrative is a necessary struggle. I don't have a conclusion based on the leaks - but I think a lot of them deserve answers. Trump saying Comey was a ""nut job"" isn't worthy of a leak. But knowingly hiring Flynn when he was under active investigation, Trump's attempt to block the investigation, and then Trump's public vs. private reasons for firing Comey are all important things and not just partisan bickering.",0

It is only a question of time before the South surrenders to the North's demand or face instant annihilation.  For the rest of the world the alternative is too horrific to imagine.  So the North will acquire by force or threat of force the Republic of South Korea.  We are too weak and divided to oppose these demands and have demonstrated that weakness for 50 years.  The very thought North Korea would give up its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them before or even after acquiring South Korea is simply laughable. Nothing will stop them.",0

Bigotry prefers to work just under the surface, acting in non-obvious ways. As long as minorities don't get too uppity, too visible or too successful, bigots are generally satisfied. But when an event like the mass murder in Quebec takes place, and society wishes to express solidarity with the victimized group, all the bigotry bursts forth. How dare society single out Muslims for special expressions of sympathy. How dare society criticize hatred of Muslims. How dare anyone peel back the scab that covers the festering mess under my skin!  M-103 has been very enlightening.

Britain colonised (looted) Asia and Africa BECAUSE it was the birthplace of the industrialized world and not the way around as you put it when you wrote ‘The UK is the birthplace of the industrialized world, because it looted Asia and Africa.’  Britain and other European nations were able to discover and subdue most of the globe because of processes that were native to Europe, only and nowhere else, principally Western Europe. The Age of Enlightenment gave rise to the Industrial Revolution which built on the scientific discoveries and technological advances made during the Enlightenment. There is no definite dating but Enlightenment started around 1650 as a rule.  The Industrial Revolution was a transition to a modern manufacturing (think guns, ships, advanced tools) and took place from 1760 to 1820. Most historians agree it started in Britain, mainly, and spread to the rest of Europe.",0

The State may have actually stayed with in a budget. And back then residents would have been receiving large checks in 1978 dollars. Maybe about as high as $12,000/ year after taxes. If it had been taken one step further and required the money to go to a retirement account until age 50 or so; younger individuals may have been a lot better off.

Canadians should be furious with Obama and Merkle. US sub prime debacle resulted in an  one trillion $ write down for both USA and EU. Economic recovery required zero interest rates/massive bond buying by their central banks/ and driving commodity prices down to near  going out business levels. The later was accomplished by fine tuning legislation to enable bank ownership of stock broker institutions/financial media giants such as Bloomberg/Reuters/Market Watch and HFTS with no limits on futures trading volumes. The HFTs can trade daily volumes of any commodity equal to 20 times/100 times/1000 times real world production volumes. Great way to manipulate prices to where you want them and then generate whatever volatility you want to generate $ billions of daily profit. Canada's commodity/resource industry ended up paying for the USA's sub prime stupidity. Remember that sub prime was the banks answer to satisfy Bill Clinton's wish to provide home ownership for every American.,0

The existing share owners should not have been protected and given the chance to sell to unsuspecting new owners.,0

"I know first hand how my personal insurance policy purchased when I turned 25 and no longer covered under my parents health plan before ACA, has changed over the years. I am in a high risk category being a cancer survivor. Even so, before ACA when I purchased my BCBS of Alaska health insurance plan, given I have a high deductible $5,000 per year. I paid roughly $120.00 per month. Over the years my plan has been grand fathered in thank goodness! Otherwise with my current income ( since that is really all the marketplace cares about) and not qualifying for subsidies, being 30, I would pay roughly $1200 a month for the same coverage I used to get for $120.00. People such as myself should pay more for health coverage as we are a more costly risk to insure.

While I would understand a motion expressing outrage and sympathy for the murders, I don't understand the need to present the same motion twice.  One wonders whether the Liberals were disappointed that the first motion against islamophobia passed unanimously, and decided to present a beefed up version so as to sow disaccord.  With 69,000 signatures in support of this motion, it seems that the majority of Canada's one million plus muslims were not very interested in pursuing this.  Meanwhile, it seems that the majority of muslims are getting caught in the crossfire, as the Liberals use less moderate muslims (or is it vice versa) to pursue their agenda.",0

"I think you might be missing the point that some are trying to make. Yes, the money that 'would' flow into the coffers is forfeited (for a certain period of time), but if nothing is built without the subsidy, the actual loss to the taxpayer is zero.   We have a housing problem in Eugene, and it is not just low income housing, it is all housing.  Low income housing won't work without some sort of subsidy.      I am not going to argue that MUPTE is the right tool for subsidy, but if low income housing is desired, there needs to be some way of subsidizing it to make it happen.  I think the community should explore this.  If everyone just keeps saying NNNOOOO!, what will happen is that eventually downtown rents will rise to the point that they allow the developers to get the financing they need to build at full market rate, and then we can kiss all hopes of affordable housing downtown goodbye.",0

The Commission investigates complaints, decides what charges to lay, prosecutes the cases (before itself), tries the cases, renders verdicts and decides on punishments for those convicted.  None of the laws to protect the rights of the accused governing the court system apply in the Commission's proceedings.

The constant problem is that the passage does not fit into the substance theology of the Fathers, so they mostly ignored it. My contention (see The Empty Christ of Philippians: Mahāyāna Meditations) is that emptying self is the main idea. The mind of Christ empties selfhood, which is why we are to take on this mind. The ancient and medieval substance theologies were skillful in their times, but today hardly anyone embraces their categories as live options for us. So many theologians are attempting to rethink the mind (and nature) of Christ ""from below,"" i.e, from a phenomenally sensitive approach. Start with the gospel Jesus, not with Greek ontology.",0

Also sounds like an abdication of the teaching authority of the leaders and the desertion of the deposit of faith.   This is treacherous ground.  Perhaps Christ is SO near that they are dragging the good and the bad into the wedding feast BUT perhaps, like Thomas Becket's murderers, people eager to please are willing to kill the truth to please (in their mind) the Pope.  In Thomas' case the killers were sentenced to death by the king.  In this case, it could mean an eternity in hell.  There can be no two valid marriages.  Annulment is already available.  Doesn't look like a good decision.  We need to pray constantly for the Church and that the true faith is preserved.  We are also guilty if we are not doing that.  We also need to let God decide. Just live the faith.",0

Casting doubt of the right of the Queen to rule is treason and the Fifth of November reminds us of the rather nasty consequences of that offence.

When asked which commandment was the greatest, Jesus also basically said that loving and worshipping God is the only way we can expand the boundaries of our self-love and self-interest and love our neighbors.

The ""current Bible"" is being changed even now in our modern times.  For example, a fellow in Montana has rewritten the Bible using ""modern language"". Even further, most Christians have NOT studied theology. They just repeat selected short Bible anecdotes.  For myself, I prefer to think of each person's image of ""his/her god"" as a very unique and idiosyncratic set of images and expectations which exists ONLY in that one person's brain. Each believer imagines very personal brain-fantasies. No other person's ""god-image"" exactly matches that of any other believer. However, ""religion"" encourages individuals to ignore many of these differences and to pay attention to some of the similarities. The Bible used gives standardization. In this way, individuals gain social contacts, mutual adulation ... and power.",0

"John - you still don't get it. SB 21 brings in MORE revenue when prices are below $105. ACES, through progressivity, brought in more above that price. But under aces the state was paying for up to 75% of the capital costs of the project. Sb 21 limited the state's contribution. It's called a trade off.    sb 21 led to a dramatic increase in exploration activities and attracted new companies to the state - this is undeniable. If oil prices didn't tank we would see even more investment.  As for the 1 million barrels per day - if you add the 200,000 from Smith Bay, 120,000 from Armstrong, 70,000 from Liberty, and 35,000 from GMT, to name a few of the projects marching towards development we will be approaching 700,000 to 8000,000 bpd.

That's why affirmative action programs were needed. People in the south especially, but not limited to them, had instituted lower level laws and practices that permanently kept Black people on the other side of the tracks. Greater equality didn't occur because Americans were rethinking their society wanting to live up to their ideals. It came from social upheaval and riots and marches and protests and Black people lifting themselves up despite extreme resistance.    That's why affirmative action happened.",0

But there is another, possibly equally damaging facet to this piece of Church history: By making visible and clear the Church's attitudes toward control, abuse, and manipulation, it has allowed members to reinterpret their own Catholic upbringing and to identify in it incidents and themes that have been damaging over their lives that they previously were only slightly aware of.

After all, sterile couples who are incapable of the procreative dimension are permitted to marry and have sex purely for the unitive dimension (allegedly these dimensions are now separable!). But couples are never permitted to have sex purely for the procreative dimension (boy meets girl, boy and girl mean absolutely nothing to each other but have sex merely to sire offspring, boy and girl part like ships passing in the night).  If two people of the same gender fall in love and choose to marry, they are as entitled to have sex purely for the unitive dimension as sterile heterosexual couples.  St Paul was speaking about heterosexuals indulging in homosexual acts. He almost certainly believed that there was no such thing as a gay person. This discovery of modern anthropology (gays exist) clearly requires new theological insight.",0
"Tennessee. Far better choice. But, your assessment of my priorities is incorrect. I don't write to decrease, but work for others to know what is already happening. No one in K-12 is destitute, period. If the rest of WA state were paid as they are paid there would be no poverty whatsoever. I would have nothing to write. But, it isn't. Not even close. My concern is the increases, always, and that they are mostly not needed in the first place, are in the wrong proportion with already wealthy recipients becoming more wealthy, and, that they are not assigned to agencies in proper proportion when they happen. Education has been the golden calf of the last decade, propped up by the Fed through a ""stimulus"" that is the root cause of our legislative problems today. They prospered in the ""Great Recession"", unlike the rest of WA state. And the bigger problem is continued expectations of increase, big numerical values.

So let me just say that despite what the ACA-supporters believe, no one in this country wants any person to not have heath CARE (as opposed to private INSURANCE), and it's emotional blackmail for the ACA to be presented as a panacea without which people will die.    Medicaid is available for those who can't afford health care; why dispense with it?  My guess is because, as a government-run program, it stinks.  Medicare for the elderly gets pretty good reviews.  So what did ACA do but involuntarily take existing health insurance coverage away from hard-working middle class workers who can't afford their new premiums and give insurance to those who voluntarily aren't hard-working (e.g., college students, single moms, their illegitimate children...).  The more the government replaces incentives for self-responsibility, the more dependent people become.",0

"@ThinkRightGM: I think expanding supply is definitely part of the solution (I don't have much tolerance for the NIMBYism from many in the detached neighborhoods of Vancouver proper).   Re: CMHC, I don't think taxpayers should be off the hook. But I do think, since tax $ are at stake, strict lending standards should be enforced - particularly since those increased mortgage insurance premium revenues in the 21st C are the product of an explosion in the amount of insured mortgages out there. As we move towards $1T in taxpayer-guaranteed mortgage debt, I don't want to find out the risk analysis was crummy or that banks were lending sloppily as things fall apart and insurance payouts start to go up. I want the banks kept on their toes and I want them to be liable if they haven't loaned money carefully. And, while acknowledging foreign $ influence, I also view the massive expansion of taxpayer-backed mortgages in this low rate environment as another key driver of the affordability crisis.",0

I need to do more research on this topic before I give a response. I prefer to have all the facts. From what I've read she had the wrong type of visa to be working in the US so for that yes she did do it wrong. Let me clarify something. I have no issue with people coming into the US to work and make a life for themselves. I have an issue with them not getting proper documentation to do so. Obviously she has her documents now and has become a citizen so regardless of how she started she is now here legally. If the people that are deported want to come back over I wouldn't have an issue provided that they filled out the proper paperwork and did it the legal way. I will say that I find it rather amusing that you guys keep saying I'm getting offended. No offence taken on this end. Just a friendly debate with fellow Alaskans.,0

Paprocki’s statement is ludicrous on the face of it as we do not deny funerals for murderers, rapists, or any others rightly or wrongly recognized by society as “evil.” In fact, the Church teaches us that all should be recognized as having “repented” if necessary, before they died. How someone as poorly educated in the working of the Church was even ordained a priest let along become ordained a Bishop is beyond comprehension.",0

Thirdly, the entire claim seems to be that the Canadian government provided historic information as to why he was refused refugee status - something that should not be a secret between Canada and our allies.

There may be an advantage to being heterozygous for this deleterious trait, which is usually the case, and is why the allele persists in the population.  The death of these individuals would not even reduce the allele frequency in the population. It has been argued that it would actually increase the allele frequency, because without the burden of parents caring for the homozygous deleterious individuals with manifestations of disease, the population of heterozygous individuals increases. AKA if you abort all hemophiliac individuals, but the parents have the same number of children, the frequency of the allele increases not decreases.",0

Now if these governments can turn around their elitist policies, make sure the working class get a fair shake, and fix all that's not fixed for decades, then everybody is for globalized free trade.

"Whatever their age or gender, and wherever they live in Canada, victims of sexual assault deserve a thorough and professional investigation of their complaint.

Either the public in some jurisdictions are making many unwarranted allegations of sexual assault, or police in those jurisdictions are unable or unwilling to correctly investigate and assess sexual assault allegations. In the first instance it means that innocent individuals are being investigated and possibly charged with a serious crime. In the second, people guilty of a serious crime walk free while laughing at the victim and our justice system. Neither situation is acceptable.

"The earth is doing what it has always done. She has fires, earthquakes, hurricanes and other forms of natural events that change or otherwise destroy the environment. When these natural events disrupt human lives by destroying what man has built and negatively impact the quality of human life or worse we call them disasters. Negative (or evil) natural events, to one degree or another have plagued humankind throughout history. So there is nothing special about the calamities we see all around us and we should be cautious about interpreting natural disasters in anthropomorphic terms.  “Mother Earth” as an analogy is reasonable when used in the proper sense that the earth is the crucible and generator of life. Attributing “anger” to this “mother” is an example of stretching the analogy.   A Christian may view such disasters in the way that the writers of the Old Testament viewed them: As God's wrath. As a way of punishing humankind for disobedience. This is the better interpretation.",0

What will happen to the matching funds when the Trump administration carries out its planned 30% cuts to HUD funding, which fund not only the low income housing tax credit program, but also the Section 8 housing voucher program? Surely the City of Seattle knows that the vast majority of new Section 8 recipients can't use their vouchers in Seattle because of the extreme shortage of landlords who will accept them. After searching in vain for 120 days for a landlord who will accept Section 8 vouchers, these vouchers expire and tenants have to renter the housing lottery. How many existing low income apartments and single family rental homes will be knocked down to build off site low income housing? Seattle has no idea, because it doesn't even attempt to track affordable units lost and gained.",0

"Technically, you are correct in that Premier Two Moms approval could be 0% but if voters decide to hold their noses and vote Liberal regardless then they would win.  Historically, however, you are decidedly out to lunch.    Usually, there is a strong correlation between the approval rating % for the party leader and the vote % the party winds up receiving.  With 3 relatively strong major parties in Ontario, it is possible for one to win a majority with 36-39% of the vote.  But no party can win a majority or even a minority if they stand at 16% in the polls and no party whose leader at election time stands at 16% in the polls will pull more than 24-25% of the vote (usually within 5 points of 16%).

"Let's assume that there is only so much money - for everything, including healthcare.   1) it is fanciful at best to presume that privatization drives efficiency 2) using financial institutions as an example to compare to the delivery of healthcare services is flawed - I have worked in both sectors and the very last thing I want is for my family to be cared for by institutionalized and revered greed.   3) By the numbers, back to the precept that there is only so much money.  Imagine the healthcare value stack.  Now add-in profit at multiple levels of the system and subtract your assumption of public sector slack.  I assure you, just look south and you will need a literal ton more money to fill the profit hole.  Add to this the motivation of private sector shareholders to increase profits - only two ways to do this - charge more or spend less.  Right now, we only have to manage one side of this equation. 4) shame on everyone for assuming the public sector is lazy.  Cost to greed is ++",0

Avoiding commodity/energy companies like the plague has helped me greatly.

The Gulf was very warm at the time of Harvey's rapid escalation in intensity. Ocean temperatures have been increasing very similarly to atmospheric temperature. Global warming.  Storm surge impacts are on top of sea level rise. Texas has experienced significant SLR, much being attributable to rising temperature.  Atmospheric water vapor increases about 7%/degree C. This influences extreme precipitation events. Those events are trending higher. Harvey was wet.

There was no fighting of the wheel as the car did not break loose, yet the instructor who was going to show me how the car would perform in the next round put me out of the car at the end of the circuit without showing me how he would have done it. .To give you an idea of the diameter of the corner, it is the same as the 270° turn onto a 400 series highway.  I also annoyed him when I took a whole minute to adjust my seat, seatbelt and mirrors before moving the car so that I was properly planted in the car.

Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to schools that are the lowest common denominator. Some want more, better, or different for their kids. So why not offer any school that is self-administering (charter, religious, classics-based, science-focussed, Montessori, etc.), the equivalent amount that public schools get. One could even make this some lesser percentage, 75% say, in the interest of discouraging unnecessary splintering. Almost every other province in Canada provides some or all funding for alternate schools.

As for the Paris Accords, I've been wondering over the last few days whether the assertions made by a number of climate advocates - all of which amount to stating that it doesn't matter what the President does so long as key States and big-business continue the trend - didn't influence Trump's decision.  In effect, he gets a huge gimme for having ""done something"", meanwhile the US continues to contribute regardless because of the efforts of others.  Since a number of State, large city and corporate entities made their position known prior to the announcement, it ends up a win-win for Trump regardless of whether he stays in or gets out.

The average change in the margin of victory as a result of a statewide recount was a mere 296 votes in a 10-year study of 2,884 elections.   The common nationwide date for meeting of the Electoral College has been set by federal law as the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.

The CDU break from traditional conservative, Catholic values of family responsibility started in the mid to late 1990s as the reality of neo-liberalism and global corporatism became clear. However, there remains much resistance in the more Catholic oriented Länder to local implementation.   Ultimately, the case is stronger that social investment and child care in Germany is more the product of neo-liberalism than democratic socialism.

But what's the baseline growth without immigration?  It might well be negative.  For example, construction firms don't build without the constant pressure of population growth.  In some sectors population growth is required just to keep wages steady.  You can't make economic forecasts in isolation; you need a baseline.

"Very good point. Our ""system"" of arbitrary stumpage fees quite arguably IS a subsidy if it's below whatever the market price would be based on open bidding. Most of the NAFTA/WTO trade tribunal outcomes favorable to Canada relied on there being little if any demonstrated damage to US interests, not that no subsidy had been provided. Now if only the dairy, poultry and egg cartels can be eliminated. These are also legitimate areas of subsidy complaint for the US and it's too bad Canadian consumers on their own couldn't get them eliminated mostly because of the lobby abilities these industries have in Ottawa. More transfers of consumer/taxpayer funds into private pockets this time by restrictive supply mechanisms. Do Americans have similar systems? Yes in oil, gas, farming and other areas and all sustained by lobby groups as is the case here. They need to be eliminated as well for the benefit of the American consumer.",0

"Re:  ""... the best iron ore in the US was probably the supply in northern Minnesota, which is mostly gone ...""  My understanding is that the tax policy of the State of Minnesota charged a premium on proven ore reserves for the iron miners - hence companies refrained from 'proving up' reserves beyond what they forecast they would mine for the coming fiscal year.  The superficial Club of Rome assessment, of course, would have been then that the mine was 'out of ore' in a year and that society was running low on iron.  But the 'shortage' was legislative, not mineralogical.  Similarly, Oregon many years ago banned the cyanide leach method of gold recovery from low-grade bulk tonnage ores.  (This technique elsewhere in the world can recover Au economically down to the level of 1 ppm.)  The great gold belts of Nevada extend right into SE Oregon, and deposits are known there (Grassy Mountain I believe is one).  We might have 10s of millions of ounces of Au in Oregon, but it can't be mined.",0

Long past due for restricted truck lanes and special passing areas which would eliminate a lot of the problem of rolling roadblocks when they try to pass each other (eg on a hill).

So the Trump regime just added 'color of skin' and 'suspect religion' are causes for denial. If so Trump should have the courage to sign a new visa agreement with Canada.",0
"Republicans can't have it both ways: either the economy is fundamentally strong and growing, in which case we can and should be maintaining or increasing tax revenues in order to balance the budget and start paying down our massive national debt .... OR the economy is weak and struggling, in which case this quarter's 3% number is just a freak aberration and we desperately need tax cuts to goose the economy.  Which is it?  The bottom line is that the alarming growth in income inequality in this country shows no signs, yet, of being slowed or reversed.  Nor does the federal deficit show any signs of shrinking -- quite the contrary.

"There was also Harper's practice of having legislation introduced through the Senate, where it would be subject to less scrutiny that stunk, just on principal.  It was a back door sleazy practice. The problems with Senate partisanship began decades ago.  There was a scandal over a Liberal appointment in the 1960s when a party insider was appointed to the senate, (Can't remember the name, but I'll post it when I do.)   It's gotten worse over the years, and the Harper years were the worst.  I believe Harper's intention was to implode the Senate from within by getting the public so upset with the Senate that it demanded abolishment.  Unfortunately, Harper does not seem to have ever given the Constitution any thought, sober or otherwise, so did not understand that wouldn't work.",0

Lowering interest rates and qualifications for low income people that really couldn't afford house payments was what caused the crash in 2008.

"Having actually been in the military and follow closely the actions taken, the surge was requested due to Turkey refusing to allow American forces to enter Iraq from Turkish territory. That was the plan and would have worked out very well. With the refusal of Turkey and no two prong assault into Iraq, the generals knew we would have to have larger forces than we had planned for the southern incursion. The surge did work to stabilize and secure much of Iraq. I disagree with your opinion of the idea of the Iraq liberation, but I guess we will have to agree to disagree about that. Yes, Bush did begin negotiations about troop withdrawals, but those negotiations were passed to the Obama administration because Bush was still attempting to get a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government.

"No white person in America can choose to ignore race -- the color of their skin and the supposed inability of them to see beyond it is flung in their face multiple times a day.  As someone who is biracial, I can say without a doubt that my white friends were never as racist as my Indian cousins. There was a time when that wasn't so, but that time passed in the 1970s. You may not recognize that if you only hang out with the race you consider yourself to be a part of, but for those of us who are happy travelers across the lines that separate us, racism hasn't been a widespread white problem in 30+ years. As for our institutions - a black man became President TWICE, which couldn't have happened without the white vote, and in most federal and state agencies, you get extra points for both hiring and services if you're a person of color.

For example they are already are #2 largest destination for exports and our exports to China are growing faster than our imports from China.  As their economy grows they are one of the real destinations we need to be looking at to grow our exports.  BUT, China's markets are notoriously restrictive and subject to a lot of government interference.  Free trade deals tend to do a good job at removing tariffs, but a poor job at removing non-tariff trade barriers, and that is where we are likely to get clobbered.  Until China has a more open and transparent government domestically I think it is naive to think a trade deal with them will work well.",0

"Thanks for this comment! Yes, increasing property taxes will cost taxpayers as much as extending the GE tax; that's for sure. As Randy Roth said, there's no free lunch. But the thing about rents is that, according to the tax research director quoted in the story (and others I spoke to) property owners tend to absorb property taxes and not pass them on to tenants as much as business pass on GE taxes. Another reader has written the director, Carl Davis, to back his claim, which is great. In the meantime, you're right to point this out, which I did in the story: property taxes are regressive to the extent that they get passed to tenants. The question is, How much do they get passed on?",0

And the word was also used a lot with respect to the staff at Charlie Hebdo who were also murdered by an extremist Islamist(s) who took offence at a cartoon of their prophet Mohamad.

I really liked what someone here said about giving the land to Washington parks and rec.  Last summer they were ticketing at Naked Falls for not having the NW Forest Pass, which they shouldn't have been if it is indeed on private land. . .  I signed this petition as well.  thanks to the other commenter for sharing this link.  Weyerhaeuser is apparently making millions charging excessive fees to recreational users for the use of the forest land.   https://www.change.org/p/oregon-state-house-stop-excessive-weyerhaeuser-recreational-fees-in-oregon",0
"Minnery is sending a message here, to all those in Alaska who believe in religious rather than secular government.  That message is meant to provoke a response, and yet two logical conundrums stand out here:  The first is that if a law is required to enforce communication between parents and their daughters, then something is likely amiss already, and the chances of such a law doing more harm than good are greater.  If our daughter had this difficult decision to make, we as her parents would be her first resource.  Why?  Because we trust each other and she knows we're on her side.   The other is that the right to vote, as well as to dissent, are secular rights; and free speech, while tied to the establishment of religion via the first amendment, certainly did not come from religion or religious institutions.  No fundamentalist religious government permits it, or votes outside of true believers within the narrow confines of religious tenets.",0
"Slip stalls are common cause. If an airplane doesn't have enough airspeed, especially in a steep bank (less lift pressure), it won't fly. An easy to make and common pilot error is not keeping an eye on the airspeed.

We all make mistakes but when we are literally fooling mother nature in order to be birdlike, she is less forgiving.",0
"What should Trudeau have done? This is my question for anyone who thinks this is horrible, terrible, the worst thing ever, etc. The Canadian Government faced a $20m lawsuit and the Supreme Court has already ruled that the government was complicit in his torture, which makes winning the case highly unlikely, or at least enough so that no lawyer is going to recommend that you try to fight it.

"Incorrect once again........  1) I didn't vote for Obama in 2012.  I did in 2008, and switched to Gary Johnson due to the runaway spending from both parties.  I repeated that vote in 2016......for a whole slew of other reasons.  2) I live in South Central Nebraska, so no, I'm not a vocal supporter of Polis, as I have never seen his commercials, and, more importantly, don't live in his district.  As a matter of fact, if I still lived where I grew up, I would not be in his district.  So, while I appreciate your accusations of hypocrisy (and, like all human beings--even you--I am sure I have been hypocritical at some point in my life), this was a major fail on your part.

"You are absolutely right about the PRC.  NK may well be the PRC's pawn, designed to drawn US attention away from PRC aggression in the S. China Sea and huge trade deficits as well as China's theft of US intellectual property on a grand scale.  Also, NK could conceivably be a tool the PRC will use to destroy the US.  If NK attacks the US and causes catastrophic damage, then the US would be weakened to the extent that it could not oppose the PRC in the S. China Sea or anywhere else.  Since the US has sold the PRC trillions of USDs worth of debt, using NK to attack could be painful for China in the short term, but the PRC thinks in terms of 100s of years, so the short-term sacrifice might be worth it for them in the long term.  You may also be correct about Russia which feels threatened and betrayed by the US -- e.g. US radar in Romania & Poland contrary to earlier US promises.  Putin may believe than most enemies of the US are friends of Russia.  For the US, NK presents no good outcomes.",0

Besides being morally depraved in that respect, you continue arguing that one who does not support unchecked oil and gas ops within City Limits must not support energy development at all...which is of course a lie and a diversion tactic.

Well.. that is, so few except all of the parasite criminals. Criminals do not care about any rules. So all of the regulations created have basically zero impact on criminals.

Now we've tried conservative policy for a few decades and it has benefited those already with enough. Oh cut regulations and remove taxes? Done that. So where are all of those good paying jobs? What has that policy done to the fabric of America. Caused more poverty and dissent. We've tried the conservative way. It hurts the majority of the regular workers. Those not earning 100,000 or more. Average income in Oregon...about 29,000 dollars. so tell me why I shouldn't want to vote for Bernie? I want to live in a country that values it's citizens. Not using them to enrich the few and denigrates the many. So yes I will be casting a vote for Bernie and Democratic Socialism. Ran out of characters in last post.",0

The boundary between 'free speech' and 'action' is quite clear when people organize and take to the streets in protest, to the ballot box, or take up arms in rebellion.  Trump's remarks, at no cost to himself,  even if a hinted suggestion, have the ability to sanctify the latter (organized rebellion against an illegimate government).  Trump can argue that he didn't say this, but the logic implies it.  So does he say these things without thinking or does he think about what he says?",0

Following that, should you apply to be a permanent resident or citizen, you will again have face-to-face meetings with government officials.  But what Leitch is demanding is that, in addition to all the other contact an immigrant will have with government officials, there should be one more where specific questions are asked, viz, ""Do you believe in freedom, equality of opportunity, hard work and generosity?""

“I have no intention of spending any of my days in a concrete box. There are things more important than your life and freedom is one of them. I’m prepared to defend freedom.” LaVoy Finicum.  LaVoy watched the ever increasing encroachment of government into the lives of the American people he has felt to make a stand for freedom.  He drew a line in the sand and that line is the Constitution in its original intent.  The Constitution of the United States is a charter to protect the freedom of man by putting strict limits on government. We are now living in a day when that supreme law of the land has been shredded by the very Gov entity that took an oath to uphold it. By their actions the Federal Government has become lawless and stalks the liberties of this land under the guise of social justice.  LaVoy died standing up against this injustice.  One day each of us may have to choose if we will sacrifice our own liberty for this empty façade of so-called security.   ...Which one are you?,0

"Commenters are saying ""What a silly place to build a village, just move.""  The villagers know that.  Kivalina was originally (for centuries) a seasonal hunting camp in a different location.  The village had to settle at the present site in 1905 because the BIA put a school there (see NANA's website).  The village has been trying for years to get Federal funding to move to a safe place on the mainland.  Barrier islands are notoriously unstable, even before climate change.  The Outer Banks of NC are periodically shored up by the Army Corps of Engineers.  It seems to me that, since the Federal government located the village there (without consulting local people?!), it should correct that dangerous error now.",1

Except for having a president that is a self absorbed buffoon, we have been down this path before.  Reducing poverty and a vibrant middle class is something the right and left should come together on, we need to demand a congress that cares for average Americans.

It is now mainstream to acknowledge the historical complicity of government and society in contributing toward today's problems.  But apparently there is no similar movement in terms of indigenous folk acknowledging the historical complicity of their own.

There is currently 5 lanes, two each, a shared turn lane and a row of parking on each side of the street.  There is lots of room on Colfax and the City should be able to get creative and come up with a better plan that maximizes both Bus and Car capacity.  Some bike infrastructure would be nice too.  Reducing parking is always a touchy subject but the City needs to figure out what it wants to do with Colfax.  Make it a thoroughfare that moves people from East to West, or make it a scaled out version of 16th St mall with public transportation and businesses as the main focus of the road. I like the idea of the buses getting priority traffic signals like they do along Lincoln during rush hour.

What caused their lawful protest to become a riot? I would say it was preordained, as evidenced by their carrying assault rifles and handguns, pepper spray and clubs. Who started it? I would say that the NAZIs KKK and white nationalists came to riot. I would say that the slightest provocation, any excuse at all, set them off. We know that after police dispersed the marchers, some tracked down and beat counter-protesters who had peaceably left the melee.  There is no equivalence between the two groups.

"Val Van Brocklin said:  ""Officers will have to be perceived as fair and impartial for their body camera video to be viewed fairly and impartially"".  Utter nonsense. Prejudging officers as fair and impartial generates no more objectivity than prejudging that they're not.   Viewing camera video without expectations one way or the other concerning the involved officer's 'fairness and impartiality' offers greater chance of unbiased assessment of his or her videotaped actions.  But without videotape we're left with little more than the officer's word in the vast majority of cases.  Unsurprisingly, that almost always exonerates the officer.  Clearly Van Brocklin isn't interested in objectivity or lack of bias--she's interested in cops not being held liable for their behavior towards the public no matter what, and regardless of video evidence.  Or, as she would prefer, without any video evidence at all.",0

"Taggart & amylou, you don't have a clue.  It's each persons responsibility to equip their vehicle properly AND drive your vehicle according to the conditions!  That doesn't mean driving at the same speed on a road despite the road condition.  Many people just drive too damn fast when the road conditions are poor or even marginal.  Look at the number of ditch diver tracks along our roads...it's abysmal.  No amount of sand trucks or road personnel crews are going to offset the personal responsibility of each and every driver on Alaska roads.  If you don't pay attention to road conditions...then shame on you, if you do pay attention and then drive like a bat out of hell...then doubly shame on you.  I constantly see these idiots every time I'm on the road...slick road conditions...they just blast on by.

Education is so universally corrupt these days it only takes a moment to find what should be questioned. They actually believe themselves worthy of the excess they exist in. And the billionaires love them, since they get affirmation of their own brilliance, since academia gives themselves awards right and left. Hard to tell which is the remora, and which is the shark. I think they change roles back and forth. All paid for by those who work with their hands.  The billionaires love them too since they get a cut of everything, small or large, both ways, whether things go up or things go down. It's why every effort is, and will be, thwarted by those who pretend to stick it to the rich. They're just looking for their own cut. Still, my only wonder in this state, is since everything is approved, how do they limit what they ask for?",0

"The problem is a lot of law breakers LIVE out there and are the daily commuters.  They'd rather just pay the tax and continue to speed to & from home.   The amount a ticket can be written for wouldn't fly water at 500$ in fact mph is how a ticket is generated on speeders so you pay per $ however many mph over the speed limit you were caught traveling   It'd be nice if they issued more tickets along that stretch though.  I figure if you park in the middle of the road or side of the road to take a picture, the cost is $250.00 for parking hazardously.   All they would have to do is keep the tickets pre written & just add a name & info to each because I always pass at least 10cars a day parked along the side of the road and someone is out of their car taking pictures or looking at the sights.  Irony is a lot of these folks are ALASKANS!  As if growing up in anchorage meant you should be on the side of the road looking ridiculous.

Remember, you paid taxes all your life to get the amount left in your estate, your estate will pay capital gains tax on every asset you leave, and then an estate tax will confiscate some more of your tax-paid principal - if there is anything left.     Jugmeet Singh of the NDP is already touting a 40% tax on estates over $4,000,000.  One person I spoke with said, ""Well it is only on estates over $4 million . . ."" but it is the principle that is wrong.  Why should heirs have their inheritance confiscated?   And why are heirs treated differently?  If there are ten heirs to an estate or one heir, makes a significant difference on the amount passed through to each individual.

They're wrong on both counts. The Hebrew scriptures include a number of texts that speak of welcoming the stranger, but scholars agree they refer to fellow Hebrews. The same scriptures portray the Hebrews as conquering and annihilating neighboring peoples, which you correctly point out is neither historical nor deriving from the exilic period.  So there is no basis for their argument, which is just fine with me.

"Netflix Canada has recently acquired most of the Ken Burns' documentaries. I watched Prohibition. There's an historian talking about the irony of prohibition's repeal. He notes that before the repeal anyone could buy liquor at any time almost anywhere. Once repealed, it was suddenly difficult to find a drink.  That's the irony of regulating and taxing the stuff. Making it legal also means government regulates the quality of the product, the times when it can be sold, to whom it can be sold, the price at which it can be sold, and where it can be sold.  When I was in college, the guy in the residence room across from me was a parttime dealer. Kids would be knocking on his door at all hours. Sometimes gravel would be thrown against my window because the stoned kids had forgotten where they were supposed to go. That will now be history.

Rather than voting for a representative to Congress, like Tulsi Gabbard for example, we instead vote for someone to vote for our representative, because their judgment on who should be our representative is better than our own.  Do you see how utterly preposterous that is?    If we used the electoral college system for voting for our representatives this would be much clearer to you.  When people vote, they believe they are voting for the person themselves, not the electors (that's how it should be).  It's bizarre that anyone would actually believe we should vote for someone to vote for us.  They're not voting on specific policy issues as a representative does.  They're literally voting for a PERSON.  That's it.    If your idea was sound then it should equally apply to Congress and the Senate.  Why not have someone else decide who our senator should be?

If you start from the premise that there is an overlap between being a cop and being a criminal (they are often cut from the same cloth)(""every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints"") perhaps universal quality child care (early learning and development) could be a long term strategy for preventing the kind of hyper-masculinity and the enabling code of silence which is making police culture toxic if it reduces risk factors in boys and teaches openness towards alternative problem solving techniques.

You claim, without evidence, that the rapid swing back up was from Clark's introduction of exceptions. Your claim is laughable, as the time frame in question also corresponds to Quebec hitting records for bringing in investor immigrants (better part of ten thousand a year, the largest portion of whom buy in BC, studies show) and to the end of the spent-out flash of purchases in the weeks just before the tax, which when spent caused a temporary lull.  http://www.chpc.biz/vancouver-housing.html",0

"Oh I'm sure the government numbers show that more people are insured now than before  but this is the same government that tells us that unemployment is under 5%, inflation isn't happening and even if you have  insurance with a deductible of $5,000.00 or more you are counted as having health insurance even though you will end up paying for the first 5k of treatment every year out of your own pocket. Sooo while the government tells us more people have coverage now than before the reality is that it's  more Obama smoke and mirrors than it is real people with real health insurance that helps pay their medical bills  and more people suffered negative impacts of Obamacare than positive impacts but what else would you expect from the largest tax increase on the middle class in the last 100 years",0

"Over a decade ago in Nome on career day at the high school I said we need more Native nurses. I got some dirty looks from a couple of the white nurses I worked with at NSHC. I am very happy to see this program. When I went to Nome I really expected to be working within the Native culture for the Native people and wanted to know why the Native hospital was being run by white people. I am mostly white, a little Muskogee/Creek. I believe everyone should have a share of the power and opportunities. Instead the very small number of Native nurses they had were bullied and run off, except for one who was bullying back which is one of the usual reactions to workplace bullying. This is the way to end abuse, incompetence and bullying. It raises the quality of care to include all of the cultures and include those who have a interest in their communities having good health care. There were lots of people at the hospital from other places that paid poorly they were just in Nome temporarily.",0

The Quebec govt isnt much better but at least they keep 19% of the company and maybe can sell it to recoup some of the investment.    Trudeau on the other hand, has proven himself completely incompetent from an economic and business perspective , first by threatening Boeing instead of making a deal and then by letting Airbus buy control of the company to move its production to Alabama. Remember this is the same Trudeau who is arguing labour rights need to be enshrined in Nafta - and Airbus chose Alibaba because of the lack of excessive labour rights.

Some SAPS members are obviously hell bent on enforcement while others take a more realistic approach.

It is not Abram who initiates casting Hagar and her son out of the camp. And an angel speaks to Hagar and giver her God's promise to make a great nation out of Ishmael.

"I think you are wrong.  If you read this article and your own writing it is the left that cannot tolerate a different opinion. The criteria followed by these psychiatrists can apply to Nancy Pelosi, Lena Dunham, Rosie O'donnell, Denby Fawcett, Cory Lum, Madonna and other hysterical leftists. The press is viewed as the opposition party because  of  what they do.  They edit tapes to change the meaning, they publish untruths or they just lie.  Look at today, the Dem Representatives telling the lie of Flynn's supposed tweet of ""scapegoat"".  All the news stations carried what they said, but did anyone see the retraction because it wasn't true? Didn't think so. The left is tolerant unless you have a different opinion. Of course the mental health community is in panic.  Perhaps not having the fear of losing a job or of not being safe might cause less therapy sessions, thus affecting their income.

"I have no dog in this fight but as is so often the case things are not as simple as they seem.  Unintended Consequences... Despite the emotion surrounding this particular deal, the consequences of breaking this lease using the ""subject to appropriation""  language is likely to have unintended negative consequences beyond the values of this lease or any claimed damage.  The ""subject to appropriation"" language is a standard and required clause in all State contracts.  The purpose is to protect the State if revenue is not available to pay under terms of the contract.  It is not intended to give the State the prerogative to change their mind. The unintended consequence of using this clause to break this lease will be to make all future contracts, leases and bond sales more expensive or in some cases impossible.  Especially those contracts involving financing.",0
"Italy has been civilized for 3000 years? Since Alexander the Great lived 2300 years ago, could you tell me who his Italian contemporaries were? The Romulus brothers?  I would advise watching the Lost Kingdom on Netflix. In 900 A.D., the Northern Europeans Vikings were a uncivilized barbaric tribe.  They also ruled large parts of the UK. At that time, barns served as palaces. Food was game meat cooked on a fire. There were no arts, poetry, paintings, or any other markers of civilization.  The Indian culture was not stagnant when the British came. In terms of science, perhaps. In the arts, the Indo-Persian poetry, architecture, etc were world class. The Taj Mahal was built at this time, and is a perfect example.  The Muslims who converted the Indians were mainly Afghans and Central Asians, not Arabs.",0

Sound familiar?  Put into context, priests, brothers and others in the church raped Jesus Christ, bishops aided and abetted the rape of Jesus Christ, and popes, including a pair of purported saints, aided and abetted the rape of Jesus Christ.   So this lent, lets dispense with a reading of the crucifixion of Christ 2000 years ago and read about the crucifixion of Christ by the Catholic Church in the 20th and 21st Centuries.",1

Actually politicians seldom listen to the best economists...if they did they would not have signed trade agreements (see Joseph Stiglitz)  they would have heavily regulated the financial industry from becoming the out of control greed machine it is with short term goals only (see Pikety and Foroohar).

We have no national strategy and the public health economics don't align. Many clinics still use paper records (only 40% are fully electronic). Wouldn't be surprised if today's labour cost of scanning/photocopying each page, one-by-one, may even take a specialized legacy skillset that demands a premium! In one study, over 80% of docs aren't even sure how patients can access their records. Messy.  Agree that hashing out fair guidelines for patients/payers/providers is important.

"another factor, aside from the temperature and precipitation shift, that can trigger a major outbreak of forest pests is a shift in stand composition.  It basically amounts to age demographics.  a healthy forest has a large number of young spruce, a small number of middle-aged spruce, and a few big old spruce.  With human prevention of fire and beetle outbreaks combined with a refusal to provide the same ecological service (ie: selectively cutting the big old trees to allow the younger trees to grow), then the stand will eventually become dominated by big old weak trees.    big trees are prime food for bark beetles because they are less able to defend themselves.

Now, I don't know if there is enough good female candidates or if there are enough women at the executive level waiting to move up but it would useful if stories like this actually examined that part of the picture instead of getting all worked up about 'diversity', that wonderfully inclusive phrase which has come to mean little. If you ain't on the 'diversity' bandwagon then you must be some kind of anachronism.   As I see it now, fewer women in general seemed inclined to want to climb the corporate ladder hence there are fewer female CEO candidates hence there are fewer female CEOs. That's just my perception and I could be wrong, but if I'm correct then this drive for more female CEOs just for show seems very shortsighted.  It assumes women want to be just like men.",0

"A lot of posters who are generally right on many things (Canadian politics, for example) are truly misguided about what is going on in the USA.

The list of everything from nepotism, to self-dealing that is going on, is closer to an African dictatorship, than a western country.  I suspect that if many of the arm-chair analysts spent some serious time in the USA they would come to know just how different things are on the ground there, versus what you think you are seeing.  I am not endorsing Clinton, or an absolving the email business.

I don't like Pelosi, but I'll still give her kudos for her comments. I would disagree on socialists not being part of the left, they had one running for the Dem nomination. They're not mainstream left, though, just like neo-nazis aren't mainstream right.",0

"I took a year of Latin in high school followed by 3 semesters of Latin at The University of Texas at Austin. My last 2 courses were Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Had I turned in an English translation on a test anywhere near what JP2 did to our English Mass with it's run on sentences and Latin words such as ""consubstantial"" and ""incarnate"", just to name 2 of scores of other words not common to the English language, I would have been lucky to get off with a C- on that exam.  The Collects are the worst. Most of us, and I include myself, can barely keep up with the run on sentences and just give up and tune out the monstrosity of JP2's Missal. Ever tried to follow a Collect spoken by a priest from Africa, Asia, or South America with an unfamiliar dialect? It gets to the point where one is trying to decipher another language! As I recall, JP2's select committee had about 1/3rd or more linguists who did not speak English as their primary language!",0

Jesus answered, ""I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.""  In Israel, going under the fig tree meant that one was going to relieve themselves---since there were no public restrooms---Jesus 'saw' Nathanael under the fig tree answering 'nature's call'.  No wonder, Nathanael stated: ""Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!  Also, I cannot imagine Jesus with children and not smiling and laughing with them. Or Jesus not smiling at the people he cured---or raising from the dead---the young man of Nain or the young daughter of Jairus---a girl just 12 years old.",0

"DHA has a unique properties due to the even spacing and maximal number of double bonds (the molecule bending at each double bond). This makes DHA a highly flexible molecule with rapid transitions (picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds). Among other things, DHA enables quantum tunneling. DHA is very important in the brain.   With so many double bonds, oxidation is a problem with DHA. Fish oil supplements, for example, have something like 5% peroxidation when packaged. Cooking presumably oxidizes a good portion, as heat, light, oxygen and time all promote oxidation. This is a reason I favour salmon roe, which I buy frozen and eat raw. The Japanese over time learned to eat Sashimi. Dr. Jack Kruse maintains that freezing destroys the quantum tunneling feature of DHA, but I haven't been able to figure out how this would be so.

(2) IGNORANCE. Mentally able. But has not learned the appropriate information, skills, mores, cultural references, etc. Mistakes follow.  (3) EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE. Smart enough, Educated enough. But fears, angers, paranoia, etc, interfere with appropriate use of information. Often overly fearful or overly aggressive.  (4) PSYCHOSIS (brain dysfunction, perhaps hallucinations,  distorted perceptions being processed).  (5) MANIPULATION. At the purposeful expense of someone else. (My mother said that some people do things ""just for meanness""). Lack of a conscience - as in ""sociopath"". . (6) APATHY. ""I don't care"". Bad results are of no concern.

Inflows of foreign capital keep prices high, far higher than what the local economy and local incomes can support. Untaxed money, especially untaxed foreign money, finds its way into the hands of purchasers who don't have to report it as such. Stop this by changing the rules.

"Multiculturalism, large waves of immigration from Asia,  new important influences of various religions, has produced a big change in Canada.

Huge changes these last 35 years, particularly since 9/11. Huge changes always have an inevitable push back from those who aren't  benefiting from the changes. Surprising the push back has not happened years ago.   In my opinion, Calgarians and Canadians in general have been very generous about accepting 10 million immigrants these last 40 years. We've been very generous about treating Muslims as equals. I was very surprised when Calgarians elected Nenshi seven years ago. They had become more cosmopolitan and generous than I knew.

"So after much political posturing by the GOP for the last 7 years, we still have the status quo. Nothing with the ACA has changed. Not one iota. The people covered under the ACA still have coverage.

The U.S. health care economy now represents more than $3T. The total GDP represents a top-10 world economy just by itself. So nothing is sustainable with the U.S. health care system.  We can shovel Medicaid dollars into the growing abyss until we reach the financial tipping point. The rest of the world spends trillions less and has far better health outcomes.  Better yet, opiod overdose is now the leading cause of death for people under age 50. Life expectancies have started the downward curve as two leading economists recently pointed out.

"While pontificating, it is also useful to acknowledge that MAD means nothing to an insane, drugged, or drunk President and since no one can stop the President from firing off the arsenal, disaster is imminent.  Nikita was good at bluster but not good at mass destruction.  A small number of massive hydrogen bombs, say 50-100 megatons, is far less destructive than the same net megatonage in 250 kiloton bombs delivered accurately to dispersed targets.  This is, of course, reflected in the US stockpile and in the heavy MIRVing of the missiles.  Of course, none of this matters, since the President can launch anything at any time and no one will stop him.  What 7000 nukes at his fingertips?  I suppose it would be fun to do it in one big bang.  2000 nukes for China, 2000 nukes for Russia, 50 for North Korea, 100 for Iran, 50 for Syria, 50 for Afghanistan, 100 for Pakistan, and save the rest for later fun.

"President Trump has never had a problem spouting off about anything and everything, regardless of the facts. Isn't that one of the things his followers love about him, that he speaks his mind, no holds barred?  Until Charlottesville, that is. Now, all of the sudden, he's discovered nuance. At a time when every decent person needs to take a stand on racism, Trump decides to be measured and inclusive. But his vague references to ""many sides"" and ""other hate groups"" add up to nothing more than a tacit endorsement of the 'white pride' types he refuses to condemn.  If Trump was personally sympathetic to the white supremacist movement it would be bad enough, but the truth is worse. Trump knows these people are the lunatic fringe but he is still willing to exploit them for personal gain. He would rather be perceived as siding with Neo-Nazis and the Klan -- and fan the flames of hatred -- than risk alienating even the most rabid members of his base.

"Alternatively, the 'boy problem' was always with us. The difference is post-school opportunities (and greater opportunity for women).   During my school years in the 60s and 70s, girls did very well academically but then relatively closed doors to most professions sent them to nursing, teacher, bank teller or retail. Between the time my big sister graduated and when I graduated, the opening of opportunity for young women was evident as more and more went to university and professions.  Less than stellar performance by boys was quite evident when I was in school. But no one worried because one could exit high school into a decent paying low skill job. Higher competition and fewer opportunities is arguably exposing what was always there.  Important to remember that in absolute terms, more young men are entering university than ever before. It is only relative to young women there is the appearance of 'decline'.",0
