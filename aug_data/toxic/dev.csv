"Nathan,  Life is beautiful.  It's death that sucks.  The Bible is where I find the stories of Jesus.  In Him I find hope for a hopeless situation.  I take the bible as authority.  All I'm saying it isn't a book about equality.  I don't think the followers of Jesus ought to be striving for equality.  That isn't why He died - to make us all equal.  He died to save us - while we were yet enemies.  In the bible you have story after story about God choosing and envious people rebelling against God's choosing.  In a word, rebelling against inequality.  I assume you know the stories.  That's the only problem I addressed. I'm not okay with the problems sin creates. My prescription is; ""first do no harm.""  Here is my point - Striving for equality is not going to solve any problems, but it will create many.",1
"20% a year salary increases in the 70's? I don't think so. Meanwhile in 1975 federal wage and prices controls limited pay increases to 10% , then 8% in 1976 and 6% in 1977. This went on until 1979. Also you have to talk in inflation adjusted dollars - the whole reason for the wage and price controls was inflation rates of 10+%.  So in terms of purchasing power those wage increases were really almost non-existent.",0
"It seems the same arguments for Canada turning the bilateral free trade agreement between the US and Mexico into a trilateral agreement would also apply to the CAFTA between the US, five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, but here Canada is left out. So why isn't the NAFTA expanded to take in all the CAFTA countries as well. Or put things the other way around, why not just have bilateral free trade agreements between the countries of North America and the Caribbean? The NAFTA seems to be poorly designed. It is not a bilateral agreement, but it is not a natural trilateral agreement either, like, say, one between the Benelux countries. A multilateral trade agreement involving these countries should surely be larger than it is, and take in more countries.",0

"I agree on part of this, but you left off the biggest playmaker of all:  Tyreek Hill.  Also, until the 2nd half of game 5, West has been a no-show.

"Trump's order was ham-fisted and terribly implemented (they have since amended the policy to accept green-card holders and those who already have visas) but the reality is people can't travel wherever they want and they can't live wherever they want. Post-national societies are a dreamworld of disconnected idealists in academia and professional activists. Trump was elected on campaign promises that represent an unapologetic contempt for progressive idealism - Trump rejects the idea that there is no such thing as illegal immigrants and is going to enforce strong borders. This policy is especially unfair to Iraqi interpreters who risked their lives to work for the US but time will tell if they will allow exceptions (it is a temporary ban). Europe has shown what happens when laissez-faire political impotence and good intentions define immigration policy - countries end up with segregated boroughs hostile to a common culture (Rotherham, Molenbeek, Paris, Malmo, etc.).",0

"'As Mr. Trump said after the first day of talks, “We had a long discussion already. So far, I have gotten nothing. Absolutely nothing.”'  I am surprised Trump is willing to admit it.  What happens to his 'great negotiation skill', which you know, prompted some people voted for him to get a better deal with other countries?  And no more talk of 'Mexico is going to pay for the wall'.  We, the tax payers, are going to pay for it! Famously short attention span, frequently reversing himself and very thin skin (and good fodder for late night talk shows), lots of failed businesses, all known during the campaign, we can't say Trump pulled wool over some voters' eyes.  Since he lost to Hillary by several millions of popular vote, I can't even say the voters deserve whom they voted for.  Yet, we have to endure who knows what kind of mess he will create the next four years.  Sigh!",0

It seems entirely reasonable to require railroad companies to bear at least a portion of the cost of establishing quiet zones in Eugene.

"The biggest problem with HART has always been public ignorance of the truth, thanks to constant lies from the government along with propaganda and misinformation spewed out by the mass media.  Although Civil Beat has attempted some balance in coverage, this is not a “commuter train” but instead pretends to be “rapid transit” which is an altogether different type of system, defined by frequent service, no parking at stations and shorter length.  Only now are some in the public waking up and realizing what a disaster has struck our fragile island. We raised the alarm many years ago but the public was not paying attention, easily duped by our ""leaders"" and major newspaper.  These same greedy, sinister forces will continue pushing this useless monster right through town.  Best alternative is rip it all down and build a Bus Rapid Transit system, but given our political structure, there is no chance that will happen. Traffic will get much worse while the city raises our taxes again, again.",0

"Ibbitson misses the point of the Trump victory. It was three-pronged. On the one hand, there were the rust belt voters who were fed up with 8 years of Obama and no change in their lot in life and a large distrust, as a result, of Clinton. Trump gave voice to their frustration and anger and they voted for him. Second was the large block of Democrats who simply stayed home because they could not bring themselves to vote for Clinton. They were either Sanders supporters who were angered at the treatment of Sanders during the democrat primaries or simply, as with the rust belt voters, didn't like Clinton but could not bring themselves to vote for Trump. Finally, there were all the white, educated women who voted for Trump as a repudiation of Clinton.  To suggest that similar circumstances could not happen here - with much less bellicosity - is foolish. At the end of the day it is about the economy. Produce jobs and Trudeau may still win. If he hasn't then he will lose.",0

Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which reports to Congress, said “the sale of Norsat to a Chinese entity raises significant national-security concerns for the United States as the company is a supplier to our military.” 4. the protocol of a national security review was not conducted at the direction of Justin.

Bumpings of revenue passengers to make room for them occurred before boarding without bumped passengers knowing the actual reason.

"I fully agree with the contents of this article and we need to do far more to help address the inequity. One of the best ways to do this is to show the data in graphs so that the visual impact is there along with the text. It is very important for all readers to realize that women and minorities have been carrying out excellent and outstanding work in Canada, only to be pushed back or left out by the dominant majority of white males. The decision-making is often left in the hands of a select few white males who are department heads, faculty deans, provosts, and presidents of universities. If they are not subjected to training in unconscious bias, they will never change their ways. CIHR has recently introduced a learning module that reveals unconscious bias in reviewers that should be taken by all decision-makers throughout Canadian universities.

"freeheels, After thinking about it for a bit (I really did consider it) I disagree based on my understanding of a Constitutional right versus a privilege granted to you by government.  Having a license means you have been granted privilege to drive after you have satisfied the government's requirements.  You have to pass two tests, you have meet a minimum age, carry insurance, and you pay for both the license and insurance. Violations of driving laws can cost you to ""lose"" the privilege to drive.  With Rights come responsibilities. I have the right to have/own a gun (for whatever purpose I want). As far as I know, I do not have to be a certain age (gifted my first rifle at age 5), I do not have to pass a test, I do not have to pay for the right to own/carry a gun.  But if I violate certain laws, then I lose my right to own or carry a firearm. Personally, I want my grandkids to have a gun safety course before they touch a gun.

He then voted FOR the bond because it was the politically correct thing to do considering he’s trying to retain his seat but if you pay attention, he did no research about the bond prior, but had his mind sent to oppose it when he sat down that night. He said so himself.  And the tax dollars he spent all that time asking about?? Perhaps another $200-300 per year per home owner for a $450 million dollar bond. People throw away that much in leftovers in a year. Celski asked questions to indicate his true feelings then pandered to the audience for votes.  Don’t be fooled.",0

The surgeon sits at a console and observes/manipulates the surgical tools in 3D vision as if he were inside the abdomen performing excision of the prostrate gland. The system controllers allow precise micromanipulation by means of electronic stabilization and motion scale reduction. The operation is much shorter than the very invasive open procedure, and patient experience more benign. Will add other details later.",0

In response to some of the people who have commented-- Don't blame your personal grudges on immigration. It is a well researched fact that immigrants are the least likely to engage in criminal behavior. And think about this-- What would you do if the shoe was on the the other foot and you found yourself unable to exist in the country where you were born? Wouldn't you also do everything you could to get somewhere safe where you could work and feed yourself? Allowing immigration is ultimately beneficial to the prosperity of a county. Look at Canada as an example. They embraced immigration and have made efforts to streamline the process. Part of why so many here are undocumented is simply because our system of legal immigration is slow and cumbersome.,0

The real goal of the GOP is what McCain tried to do (and was almost laughed off the stage).  Replace comprehensive insurance for everyone with catastrophic insurance and a health savings account (it would have worked better with an additional health line of credit), adding market mechanisms to health purchases.  Of course, the line of credit would end the need to shop around and show that health care is not a normal good - use is not tied to market competition - you get it and worry about paying for it later.

Ratzinger not only suppressed that study but ordered a contrary study which the CDF did publish. The prime author of the published work was Aime- George Montimort, whose views are available in English as ""Deaconesses: An Historical Study, 1986.""  So there is  dispute. The essence of the dispute, IMO, hangs on being able to adopt the Orthodox understanding of their own liturgical books (Euchlogia in this case) which are consistent on female deacons from the 8th to 14th century. All agree deaconess had distinct functions.   It is a pleasure to discuss this with you.",0

Fact checkers give the Trump administration two Pinocchios for asserting that the Obama's order was the same as Trump's. Obama — and Democrats in Congress — wanted to require greater visa scrutiny of anyone who had traveled to those countries, not target those who are citizens of those countries.  In fact, when given a chance, the Obama administration specifically rejected the citizenship-based restrictions that Trump has now ordered. So while the names are the same, the approach is the polar opposite.",0

Where was ""fair"" when these doctors were working 36 hour shifts for multiple years,  underwriting the costs of medical care with their servitude?

The jobs created by these industries are part-time or minimum wage. Softwood will  be impacted by the expiration of the 2006 accord and US protectionism. Meanwhile, full time earnings have fallen dramatically in real terms which means more debt and less disposable income. This is important when you consider that small business is 31% of GDP. Typical household debt for people under 35 has risen by $20,000 and it takes on average 18.5 years to save for a down payment comparatively to only 8 years when the BC Liberals took over in 2001.

"This author doesn't even grasp what the PFD is. He seems to think it is just a cash assistance program and not a sovereign wealth fund (you know that whole ""our resources"" thing). And so he easily equates his version of what the PFD is with other government assistance programs and government funded activities (his whole argument that if kids are getting schooled then they don't deserve dividend; and if people are getting government assistance in other ways they don't get a dividend.) But of course he only applies this logic to the things he does like as a right wing conservative. By his logic you could apply the same to any benefit anybody receives from teh government. Drive on the roads, get serviced by the ferry, have an airport, have your state roads plowed, well consider those a ""user fee"" and subtract it from your dividend. Basically this guy is out to lunch.",0

Jennifer your piece today was so honest and heart felt. It is a tough lesson in life today but I have to say that it has been around long before emails and texting.

In 1989 our son was killed suddenly in an accident and I have still not heard from about ten good friends in response to a letter I painstakingly wrote t each of this loss. I was ‘ghosted’ then because perhaps it made them uncomfortable to talk with me. Nothing surprises me in life now.

Islam and Catholicism mirror each other in their views on abortion and same sex marriage. Can you EVER recall a liberal bashing a Muslim for their views? No? Why? You will be labelled a bigot. Can you EVER recall a liberal bashing a Catholic for their views? Yes? Daily? Why? You are now a progressive.

There was another lawyer at the office and he didn’t even bother to greet us. After the clerk did the paper work he just stamped. Then they messed up with the date of closing and they blamed on the fax being unclear. On the day of closing they had no idea when the key to the apartment was. They said they would call me about the key and I had never heard from them after. I had to make so many phone calls and finally I got the key from the builder 3 days after closing. Terrible service. Will not recommend Axess to anyone. Painful!,0
"A similar study was done by the American Enterprise Institue in 2014 of all states.  It found Alaska's government employees made 4.6% less, within 2% of what this study found, so the findings have some vaildity.  That study also found that 8 states paid their employees wages closer to even with the private sector.   More than half were between 4-6%.   What it means is that Alaska state employees are not  overpaid relative to the private sector or other states.   Nor are they underpaid.    Total employees are at 2006 levels.  It means the problem isn't too many overpaid state employees.   We didn't add them because the production and price of oil were high,we added them because we added people to the state.   Our problem is that our only revenue source depends on the price and production of oil.  And right now, both are low.   More population equals more expenses.  Revenue must include low income and sales taxes to balance the increased cost that comes with more people.",0
"I think your observations are well made and your points well taken.  I think that antipathy for Clinton was a driving factor for many voters and, importantly, for many who chose not to vote. Many of these people did just as you say: they knowingly voted for someone who is a moral train wreck and worse.  However, I suspect many people voted for Trump believing that he didn't have a chance -- and that they wouldn't have done so if they believed that it was their vote that would make him president. They didn't believe much of what he said, but they didn't think it would matter because they didn't think he'd win.  But it did matter and it does; and we have a dangerously incompetent, emotionally unstable, ethically bankrupt president-elect about to succeed to the presidency.",0

"So, wait: the whole legal argument aside, [though I am not dismissing it, as it is crucial to whether or not the code change is reasonable and enforceable] did everyone miss this nugget?  Philip Ragaway, the owner of [a building containing] the now-defunct Alhambra Theatre… spent about $173,000 to install sprinklers in [two] buildings [he owned.]  NOTE: that's an average cost of about $86,000 per building.  [Ragaway] says the cost of the new sprinklers forced him to raise the rent at the Alhambra Theatre from about $4,000 to about $7,000 a month—which caused the club to go out of business.  NOTE: the owner is attempting to recover the cost of improving his building in less than three years here, at some $36,000 per year, despite a far longer recoverable time period defined in tax codes. Hmm… it seems as though greed on the part of the owner largely triggered the demise of the Alhambra Theatre, doesn't it?",0

Then, as now, I don't really think that the public knows the answers to these questions.  It's going to be a steep hurdle for most commuters when they factor parking into the equation involving their overall daily expense AGAINST the flexibility of driving to work and added mobility of having their cars in the downtown area.  It's almiost impossible, given the information that the City and HART has shared with the unwashed public, to estimate what the fare structure will be.  I suspect that the fares will be initially set at non-sustainable levels simply to attract ridership and will never reflect what is truly needed to pay for operations and maintenance.  The HART will forever require heavy ""subsidies"" from the taxpayers AND will never have the impact of easing traffic congestion as told in the fairy tales by the spinmeisters downtown.  SHIBAI!",0

On the other hand if he goes out there and starts throwing picks, Denver ends up losing half of their games with him and he gets injured. We will have an all out QB mess on our hands.   Frankly, I am already tired of all the QB focus this past few years.

The RCMP are arresting and detaining them under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and turning them over to Canada Immigration for processing.  There is a very good legal reason why refugee claimants (not asylum seekers which are a completely different class of persons) are not being charged in respect of their entry to Canada.  Under Article 31 of the 1951 Convention on Refugees Canada has undertaken to not prosecute refugee claimants for illegal entry into Canada including any issues of false documents or fraud relating to that entry.  Canada has enacted that exemption into our domestic law as required by the Convention in various iterations of our immigration legislation over the years. Currently that exemption is contained at s. 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  So no charges because the law exempts refugees recognizing that refugees who are fleeing persecution are different from other migrants.,0

In a democracy, lawmakers invariably only enact laws that the majority will agree with and abide.  And any law that the majority of citizens disagrees with cannot long stand.

"RE: Boston Globe commentary: ""For some Catholics, endorsements from the pulpit don't work""  The author is right on target.  In fact, prelate pulpit political endorsements imply that the laity are too stupid and spiritually vapid to sort out complex issues for themselves,  and should instead obey the voting dictate of the local bishop... a man whose first and only allegiance is to Rome, not U.S. representative democracy.   I've watched our own local bishop happily go down the rightwing culture war rabbit hole of conspiracy theory more than once while issuing letters on how to vote on issues and candidates.  His tunnel vision and lack of regard for complexity is astonishing.   The olds days of blind obedience to prelates are over...  it's no wonder that certain retro-bishops and their followers long to return to the 1940s and 50s... no one would actually have to learn and think.",1

"This kind of thing happens so often that many youth are complacent with obeying regulations. It's not at all uncommon in many places in Oregon that a person will take a deer for another person.

I have never met one person who is not in my life.   Being 19 and doing something stupid is not unusual. Especially in the hunting world. And especially for youth that have no mentor or were not brought up in respectable family. I remember at that age some of my fellow peers would take deer as food was needed, legally or not. This was common in the outlaying rural areas. Half the people did it so it was just not talked about.

They come in with a plan, part of which is to do as much damage as possible before anyone knows what's going on. The reactions of potential victims are likely going to be all over the place, and if additional firearms are brandished, the likelihood of more innocents being killed only increases.  Also, mass killers usually come in having already decided that they won't survive. They aren't going to be dissuaded by the possibility that their victims are armed.  We are a nation raised on cops and robbers TV shows and westerns, where the good guys are always calm and their aim steady and true. Sadly, real life isn't like that.",0

So what happens when a district gets attendance figures so low that there's not even enough students to justify one school, and now the board is considering merging districts and having one central school for multiple districts, which is what happened in this area?  Seems to me that centralization is the RIGHT answer.  The WRONG answer is for the parents to be selfish and work with the separate board to build a new school in their district that won't be any more viable, long term, than the one that just got closed.

It must be that way to maintain a balance between the states.  Otherwise, any state other than NY and CA will have no representation.  The founders were brilliant enough to realize that any state having a monopoly will destroy other states and the republic for which the Constitution stands.  It is the opposite of what you are saying.  No, your vote will not count more in one place than another.

Indeed, speaking out internally, openly on such unsanctioned issues violates the internal culture of the organization.   Voting, helping candidates generally, and personally running for office is always encouraged but seldom mentioned over the pulpit - and then mentioned only in a non-partisan way.

Recently I made the decision to join the Conservative party. I did so in order to be able to vote for a leader who could represent the values of the majority of politically center Canadians of all colors and religions who want to have a party in power that can ensure that this country continues to offer our children and grandchildren the same great opportunities in life that we were blessed with. That is the job of government and there is no other party who can offer us this. This is the only way that the Conservative party can win and the future is dark if we continue to have a Liberal government that does not understand that we need to get our own house in order before we can be in a position to improve the lives of people outside of this country. We need to have a fiscally right wing but socially left wing government - something in the center.   I encourage all Canadians in the political center to join so that they can vote for a leader who can win the next election.,0

"What kind of witnesses shall we be? It depends on who the “we” are. I’m a person of color so I feel, hear, and experience racism and bigotry when it shows up. So I am and will be a witness who is loud in my protest of it. To many white people, my loud protest, by itself, is called “reverse racism.” So, to many I am a racist just because I protest.   Whites can’t be witnesses against such things because they don’t know what racism and bigotry from other whites feels like. So even a little protest is seen as a monstrous act of reverse racism. They can empathize. They can march. They can voice vocal protests. And that’s all good. It needs to be done.  So even in the face of racist killings in our country and bigotry of the Trump kind, whites have to drum up the courage to make a stand against something they can't and don't and won't understand. People of color already have that kind of courage because it is a built-in mechanism for survival in America as we know it.",0

Many of the posts themselves might warrant a ""sort of"" by those of us who are sort of tolerant and, be given the benefit of the doubt as ""civil"" individually.

When you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice, you may know that your society is doomed.” and:  ""Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual)."" 	1",0

According to recent data from the Marine Conservation Alliance and from the Seafood Market Information Service (numbers from 2011 to 2015) the total value of all Alaska seafood export is about $3.3 billion.  In 2015, all AK salmon yielded about $1 billion.  The contribution from greater Bristol Bay runs about 10% each year.  At best, the BB salmon value might top $100 million.  All of Alaska exported about 250,000 tons of salmon in 2015.  Even if 20% of that came from Bristol Bay fisheries (100 million pounds) to ""feed"" people, say a pound of salmon per day, would satisfy 270,000 people.

Such a request might not have been granted, but they would have shown that they are 100% against the police, but they are not.  They want the police presence for their personal safety, just not inside the march.

It seems disrespectful to his former students, to say the least,  to disbelieve all of them while accepting Furlong's claims of innocence, instead.

"Why doesn't Ontario just develop CO2 ""heating machines"" .   The CO2 molecule is claimed to be so efficient at trapping and preserving heat at present levels of 400 parts per million of the atmosphere , or one CO2 molecule in every 2500 other atmospheric molecules , resulting in this put of control warming. According to Wynne's commissioner of climate change the CO2 molecules last nearly forever in the atmosphere, generating heat continuously. To solve two problems with one solution why doesn't the Wynne government mass produce transparent vinyl tanks of about 400litres in volume , fill them with captured CO2, thus preventing the CO2 from entering the atmosphere, and make the tanks available to homeowners as "" heat pumps"" .  Just one day in the sun would probably cause those millions of concentrated CO 2 molecules to vibrate and create enough heat to warm a house for hundreds of years.

"http://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/ New DOJ Statistics on Race and Violent Crime  This table can be used for a number of interesting calculations. First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.  Interestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time.",1

Regarding Canada, give Trump something to make him feel good and he can go back to his base and say look ""We're winning again"". If Canada decides to fight Trump he'll hurt us somehow. He's vindictive and unpredictable. I don't trust his instincts. I'd be very careful as a Canadian going into these negotiations.",0

Granted most of this article was simply quotes by others and Mr. Blair does have a link to a BBC piece that documents it all, including the anti-Semitic incidents.

The satellite methodology is well explained on wikipedia and of course the temperatures determined by satellites can be verified by other means.  I don't pretend to understand how radiances in various wavelength bands can be converted to  temperatures but I can understand why it is more accurate for determining global temperatures.  There are many areas of science - complex atmospheric physics for example - that only an expert in that field would understand. Regarding land-based sensors - you can walk a mile away from them and get a different temperature or walk up or down a hill from their placement and get a different temperature - are they in shade some of the time or full sun - are they placed in a heat sink and well maintained.  In climate change we are often talking about 10ths of a degree difference so I can't put a lot of faith in ground-based sensor data.,0

"So I did some looking. 2010 stats. Generally speaking 1/500 houses have a fire of some sort/year. The average damage being about $18,000. About 1/3000 burn to the ground or totaled. Total fire losses in the US divided by total houses = about $58/ $170,000 house or $68 for a 200K house.  In 2011, the average house in Alaska paid $856/ year in home owners insurance. OF course home owners covers more than fire. So if 75% of home owners is just for fire then the insurance companies are charging about 10 times  costs of the expected loss. Only 2% of the fires are caused by smoking while the biggest cause, 45%, is kitchen fires. Heating caused 13% and electrical 7%. Since 2007 fires and damages have decreased 22%. But I will bet your insurance rates increased about 20% so these numbers may be much worse. Sounds to me like a great investment for the Permanent Fund to get into.

Guess what the CBC did? Well the CBC spent the entire time describing the Indian Army and how Indians from India were involved. Can you believe it? Indian soldiers, from India,  a nation of hundreds of millions of people with their own commerations and events were more important to publicize than Canadians? Believe me, India doesn't remember or commerate the sacrifices of Canadians or Canada. Nobody else in the world remembers the sacrifices of Canadians but Canadians. How about the CBC doing its job and broadcast the sacrifices made by Canadians on one of the very few days of importance to Canada instead of creating its usual false diversity narrative.",0

"You obviously have ZERO science background and have no understanding of genetics.  Ever wonder why there are 'miscarriages"" (proper name is 'natural abortion')? About 98% of them are because there are genetic abnormalities in the fetus. In fact, when these are developed to say 3-4 months and caught in the ER, it is common to see why the body aborted it.  However, a number of genetic abnormalities actually are survivable. With loads of medical support (i.e. a lifetime of large medical bills), we see hydrocephalics  that make it to term and will then survive to age 5, 10, or even 30 years.

Either way, that Washington pounced on this to attack Damascus only demonstrates that the Neocons (entrenched in Trump's administration as they were in previous ones) have not deviated from their ""regime change"" goal of toppling disobedient dictators.

The Saudis, however, viewed the release of 28 pages as vindication because the U.S. never proved that the government knew of or supported the plot.

Once in a while, we get collectively upset about abuses: protests against racism, homophobia, and xenophobia, protests against unlivable minimum wage, solidarity against bullying, outrage against the ""culture of rape"" in universities and the military, etc.    In some cases we've made good progress despite backlashes by the powerful.

What makes it criminal is when adults take advantage of that occurrence. That's why Colorado decriminalized teen sexting between kids. It is still a crime for adults who are five years older than a child (I'm not sure about the exact age difference; most states are about five years.)   Back to your making a bomb comparison--yes, kids know they are not supposed to blow things up and injure others. But even then, their punishment is typically much less than that of an adult who commits the same crime. Their brains are still developing. The fact that they are treated differently is anything but ""bizarre.""",0

They aren't lamenting Clinton's loss or relitigating 2016.  My impression is that most liberals are done with Clinton.  Coverage of Clinton seems way, way more intense in conservative outlets.  Maybe it's an effort to distract from Trump.  Maybe they want to draw parallels between conservative Trump supporters and liberal Clinton ones.

"Balto, if all the people (and businesses) currently paying insurance premiums paid those into the single-payer system as (gasp!) taxes, that must be enough to pay for all the medical care (for reasons below).   1. This new system would have negotiating power with which to drive down pharmaceutical prices and eliminate other excessive costs.   2. Preventive care is often less expensive than acute care, and if everyone were covered, preventive care would be much more likely.   3. No insurance company advertising costs, excessive administration, profits, etc.  4. If everybody else in the world can do it (that is, cover everyone with better care at lower per-person cost), why can't we? Are we stupid?   But you raise a legitimate question: If people are ideologically opposed to taxes -- and would rather have a screwed-up system with high premiums, inadequate coverage, many people not covered at all, etc. -- then what can we do? Not much.   But claiming that we can't afford it is hogwash.",1

"As regards item [2], there is no promotion policy in elementary schools. So in the vital K-3 grades where kids MUST learn the basics in order to learn at higher grade levels, the kids are promoted whether or not they have mastered the basics. Thus do many kids find themselves sentenced to a tail chase for the remaining 9 years until they either graduate or, as often, drop out. Those that do go to college most often spend a year in remediation courses to  learn what they failed to learn in high school. For a great many it takes 5 or 6 expensive years to earn a “four year” diploma.  And this is EXACTLY the way the Democrat Party wants it.  If these bright capable kids ever DID get a competent education, these one party political hacks would be tossed out on their plush kiesters in a New York Minute and well they know it.
