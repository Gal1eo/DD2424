"I feel like Trudeau is digging himself an even deeper hole on this one, by oversimplifying the calculus on small business tax planning.

For one thing, small businesses don't generally earn the same amount each year.  They may average for example $150,000 but that could be $100k one year and $200 the next.  Of course they would benefit from tax deferral strategies like investing within the company during the good year, and paying out a dividend (to one or more share classes) during another year.

"Sanctimonious, You really ought to read up a little bit on history and you will see what nonsense your examples are. The democratically elected government of Iran back in 1953 (a constitutional monarchy) was overthrown because the supposed 'good men' of the CIA and MI6 did not approve of the government: The CIA did not like an active communist element in the population, and the British oil company (the predecessor to BP oil) refused to renegotiate the disproportionate split in oil revenues to benefit Iranians. The prime minister of Iran then nationalized the oil industry. Hence his overthrow (admitted by the CIA and MI6) and the installation of the Shah - brutal, profligate - until his overthrow by the revolution of 1979 when Komeini ultimately seized power by the killing of thousands of liberals etc. So much for the 'good men'. Many observers place the rise of ISIS at the door of Bush and Blair for their war on Iraq. North Korea? I think the good guys tried - Korean War.",0
"Eugenean- As far as Deady-- did he simply reflect the values of his day or did he go beyond?  Regarding slavery,  this was not just an issue, but THE issue of the era, one so big we had to fight a horrible war over it-- and Deady was regarded  as the strongest pro-slavery voice in Oregon.  
Moreover, he never admitted he had been wrong nor did he ever admit slavery was evil.  He continued his contempt  for those who regarded slavery as a moral issue all his life-- while the report listed two diary entrees, there were actually two others which revealed his lifelong sympathy for slavery.   
I'd  add that while we should not judge historical figures by ""contemporary values"" I'd suggest there are universal values and that American slavery grossly violated them.

HOWEVER-- In my view  President Schill is correct in weighing  this decision further, for on- balance, when considering the many admirable qualities Deady displayed, truly this is a tough call on a complex man.",0

1. By the very existence of the Green Party it causes change and the democratic party to ""account"" for it. A Green vote is not wasted, actully if one wants to vote Green and doesn't, their vote IS wasted. A growing and healthy Green Party is absolutely necessary for changing the political system.

2. It is a false ""fact"" that the Green Party vote caused the defeat of Al Gore in the 2000 election. Just because one voted Green didn't mean he/she would vote democratic or even vote at all.

3. Bush didn't become the ""war criminal"" (your words not mine) until long after 911 and even longer after the 2000 election.

4. We (neither does Gore) have no idea what policies and actions Gore would have implemented regarding 911 if he won the election.

"Image manipulation could defeat this system but it would just result in the image being discarded from the system for classification.  You wouldn't really be defeating anything.

I don't work at Facebook but probably what they are doing is analyzing a ton of nude images of regular people to create a features database that can quickly analyze shapes and lines in an image and give back a probabilistic result that any future input image contains a nude person.  This will probably be used for early detection and prevention.

If done properly, there would be no feasible way for a person to retrieve any source images without having every other source image (or most of them).  These systems combine large amounts of information to derive very general features that aren't specific to individuals and the original data is thrown away.

My own opinion is that while this may have good intentions and even be safe to some extent, you never have to worry about nude images you never take.",0

"""Republican health bill would widen America’s wealth gap"" Well, that's the whole point of the bill. It has nothing to do with healthcare. It's a transparently obvious giveaway to the super-wealthy.

For 8 years, Republicans used opposition to the ACA as an accelerant, like an arsonist with gasoline, in order to rally their base. It was obvious throughout those 8 years, that they had no healthcare ideas of their own, and, now that they have a Republican President and control of both houses of Congress, they're like the dog that caught the car. They had no idea what to do next, so in three weeks they slapped together this mess. What they've come up with is potentially disastrous from the healthcare standpoint, but it achieves a more important Republican goal — widening the wealth gap by further enriching the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else.",0

Actually no they aren't.

The Conservatives were offering increases tied to nominal GDP with a minimum of 3%.  The Liberals are offering a straight 3.5%.  Since nominal GDP was expected to grow at about 4% per year on average the Conservatives deal would probably have resulted in larger increases on average, though the Liberal deal had more consistent and certain increases.

There hasn't been an airline merger that resulted in an airline with a better product and there is no reason to believe that this one is going to be the exception.  Alaska Air paid to get Virgin America for 2 reasons.  Virgin's prices were keeping fares down on lucrative routes so now they can raise prices plus they get control of landing slots/gates in east coast airports (e.g., JFK, LGA, DCA, DAL) that they couldn't get into otherwise.  Nothing will remain of Virgin by the time Alaska Air is done with them and Virgin's customers will simply leave Alaska Air.  All of that said, I'd be happy to be proven wrong.",0

For the same month the Teranet National Bank HPI registered a 14.2% inflation rate and 13.9% for May. (The replacement cost CPI for June actually reflects May prices.)

"Did you even read the article?  
The current model is no rent controls for new builds and no rent controls for vacancies for pre-1991 buildings.
Imposing rent controls on post 1991 buildings means no developer in his/her right mind would build new.  Given that Toronto has grown by about 23,000 people a year the city needs about 10,000 new housing  units.
So without new rental units the rental market will get tighter and it will be harder to find housing.  Ethical landlords will abandon the rental market.  Unethical landlords with reduce maintenance to a minimum, if at all, ask for under the counter payments for new tenants and actively work to have old building declared uninhabitable so that the can be torn down.  Landlords will now have their pick of tenants and it will be the poor and marginalized that lose.
Some tenants will also ask for money under the table for subleases.

"Dershowitz wrote last March: 

If the case reaches the Supreme Court, a major issue will be whether campaign rhetoric delivered by Donald Trump, when he was a private citizen running for president, may be considered by the courts in deciding on the constitutionality of an executive order. The lower courts gave considerable, indeed dispositive, weight to these anti-Muslim statements in deciding that the travel ban was, in reality, a Muslim ban that would violate the constitutional prohibition against discrimination on the basis of religion.  

Under that reasoning, had the identical executive order been issued by President Obama, it would have been constitutional. But because it was issued by President Trump, it is unconstitutional. Indeed any executive order issued by President Trump dealing with travel from Muslim countries would be constitutionally suspect because of what candidate Trump said. 

President Trump admitted in a tweet that it was anti-Muslim, that argument doesn't stand",0

"Ramadan Chokr is a hypocrite when he claims concern for the safety of others, given that his own organization officially endorses spousal abuse.  

The imam of the Sammamish Mosque, Wassim Fayed, published a video of one of his lectures (http://www.popmodal.com/video/7382/US-Imam-Allah-is-clear-you-can-hit-your-wife) in which he explained to the men of the mosque that they should hit their wives if they refuse to wear the hijab.  This video demonstrates that wearing hijabs isn’t as voluntary as Muslims (and their American aiders and abettors on the “multicultural” left) would like us to believe.

Muslims need to learn that hitting women is unacceptable, illegal, and immoral.  And when you see Muslim women wearing their symbols of oppression and second-class citizenship at the local mall, don’t criticize or harass them.  It is likely that they’re wearing their hijab involuntarily and under threat of violence.",1

An alarm should have sounded as soon as it turned toward Canadian police equipment. Of course it'd steal technology! (That's what they do.) I wish it weren't so, but (for now) it is.

It's worse for the UK, where manufacturing was destroyed by Thatcher (as the unions were so stroppy) and replaced with a middle-class (no-strike) economy.

Babcock is totally off-base here..though no doubt Republicans will try to win back this seat for themselves. Pretty funny that if Republicans actually voted two ballots in Shungnak..only two were for Nageak (the Democrat caucusing with the Republicans). Maybe only two Republicans in Shungnak? What's worse is in Barrow where at least one Democrat was given a Republican ballot only and not allowed to vote a Democratic ballot and was concerned enough to report it to elections and elections responded.. Perhaps explains Nageak's 84% lead in Barrow.. http://midnightsunak.com/2016/08/26/friday-sun-august-26/,0

To refuse to admonish those who are capable but will not kneel or (more generally) to catechize your congregation in the theology and tradition of kneeling is un-Christian and manifests a defecit of love for the laity.

This is the new clericalism--Baby Boomer priest decides the laity should not kneel before the Lord, so a pious practice dating from apostolic times is not explained and the typical means to facilitate it are taken away.

But Google has it that you are an illicitly ordained priest in a breakaway sect (however reasonable its origin) that has become the post-Christian/moralistic-therapeutic-deism equivalent of the SSPX, so I presume laity who place themselves under your care do not end up there accidentally.

The 3/5 rule was a result of the enslaved status of blacks.... not a cause if that enslavement.

Ironically, in the Constitutional Convention, it was the slave masters of the southern states that wanted slaves counted as full persons vrs the northern state representatives who wanted slaves counted not at all because they were not free men eligible to actually vote.

The fascist lunatic, Kim, who believes he is a living deity destined to unite the Korean Peninsula under his divine Orwellian, totalitarian rule will never give up his nuclear weapons.

Hence the dialectic is not dependent necessarily upon action.  Trump and his staff stated, as noted in my posts above, that NK will be attacked if it refuses to denuclearize, even if it does not attack anyone first.

The irony of the much stricter sanctions, (especially banking, textiles, and oil), is that the financial strangulation of NK will encourage Kim to attack first.

For example: in human history over the last 9,000 years, only for less than 200 years has slavery been considered wrong.  De facto slavery is still common in parts of the world.  Free markets permit that.
.
So we prohibit child labour and enforce minimum standards for workplace health and safety, working hours, and so on.  All of it is ""market distorting"".
.
Not since the 1890's has there been as large an imbalance of power between private sector employers and individual workers as there is now.  Consider the ubiquity of unpaid internships.

As an issue of basic principles of economics, addressing the market failure to establish a minimum wage is not fundamentally different from prohibiting child labour.  They both arise from exactly the same phenomenon of gross inequality of bargaining power.",0

In regards to Cali weighing this as his second, they simply can't, as misdemeanors don't travel across state lines, with a few narrowly tailored exceptions, such as sexual assault or DV's. Only in cases of both classifications where a registry is maintained in both states; obviously SA's are registered nationally, while not many states maintain a misdemeanor DV registry. It's kind of crazy that an insurance company can weigh prior offenses to deny, or to charge exorbitant rates, based on someone's driving history nationwide, but the courts can't - but that's the reality.

As a result, the expectations were that no classified messages would be ON the system in the first place.  The message formatting would be different (since it was unclass, the various classification headings on messages would not be formatted in.  It is this discrepancy that allowed some classified traffic, when typed into the non-classified system, to slip through readers' attentions.  As a result, out of the 10s of thousands of messages sent in this system, only a very few contained classified material, and they were, from what I have read, been marked in a paragraph classification style.

Yet because He is a loving God, full of patience and grace, He provided us another option rather than simply accepting our ancestors’ rejection. Earth became a proving ground to see who will choose God’s ways and who will not. Without difficulties, how could that work? This is God’s Plan B, and all that is required is for us to accept His Son who sacrificed himself for us. Each of us gets to select our own destiny. Our life here is short compared to what awaits, so choose wisely. You are leaning heavily towards atheism today, so I don’t think you qualify for agnostic of the month.

"Unions pay NO TAXES!!!!!

Who are the real 1%

Today, in Canada, tax exempt labour organizations, including unions, are not required to make public their financial affairs. This is in contrast to countries like France and America that have public union disclosure as a result of union leadership in seeking and supporting it. Numerous other nations such as Germany and Australia also have public union financial disclosure.

Labour organizations are exempt from taxation. Unionized Canadians who pay dues deduct those dues from their taxable income. Dues are almost always a “condition of employment” – employees who do not pay them can be fired from their jobs – a possibility sanctioned by labour codes. Strike pay is also not taxable income. Unions transfer dues to local, provincial and national umbrella labour organizations.

"While in her own mind Denise Dresser can equate legitimate refugee status to that of economic migrant status, others do not see it that way. Those legitimate refugee's which Canada does accept, come from area's of the world which are devastated by war, persecutions and uncontrolled violence. Economic and social migrants on the other hand, are accepted upon certain conditions of education and wealth creation. These conditions are related to Canada's own economic and social needs. In this sense, a refugee has a need to be here, while an economic migrant does have other viable options.
If Ms. Dresser is so outraged at the US sanctions, perhaps she should return her degree to Princeton. After all at her age it is her peer group which has set those conditions of NAFTA. I don't think anyone has the right to have it both ways, so to speak.

I believe that most successful dividend (distribution) investors look first at how likely that income payment is likely to continue to be made. In oth words: safety always comes first. But from there, we may see a divergence. 
Some put yield next. Their goal once they feel their income is safe is maximizing current income. Growth of that income is less important.

Ridiculous and transparent media tactics.  He actually answered the question once, which he felt was enough.

As to ""resorting to flight"" to avoid answering questions, this is a bit rich in that the PM and his finance minister literally resorted to flight Monday and apparently for the rest of the week to avoid answering tough questions in parliament - remember parliament where our elected, loyal opposition is supposed to ask government ministers questions and they in turn are supposed to answer them?  - flying from Ottawa on the taxpayers' dime to several photo opp locations where adoring media will get to ask about Justin's socks and other gripping issues.",0

Senator Dunleavy has worked with other legislators for years developing solutions to Alaska's challenges. He happens to be a budget hawk and believes that our current state budget has blown out of proportion over the last 10 years and there has been very little evaluation of inefficiencies, redundancies, and downright projects and programs the State should not be funding. I think it is essential that we have legislators asking hard financial questions if we are getting the value for the dollar we are spending. State government should be held accountable, not only in good times but especially in times of fiscal restraint. Senator Dunleavy is asking the serious questions. Those who support big government without restraint will obviously object.",0

If this is indeed the direction the world is taking, as unfortunate as that may be in many respects, Canada cannot stem the tide.  Instead, if Canada wishes to continue to prosper in changing times, we need to embrace a more realist foreign policy strategy which directly pursues Canadian interests in all our economic and political endeavors.  Where our interests align, we should indeed work with Mexico.  However, where they diverge, we must act in our own interests.  I'm afraid the postwar consensus has indeed come to its end and we are back to the 1930s again.  I hope I'm wrong, but I wouldn't bet the fate of Canada and our security on hope.",0

"I have a book somewhere, published in 1974, which details this. You had the City of Anchorage, with police powers citywide, whose corporate limits stretched south to between Fireweed and near Tudor depending on exactly where, and east to between near Boniface and Patterson depending on exactly where. The borough had the ""Spenard Police Service Area"", which stretched south from city limits to Dowling or pretty close, extending to around 68th along the Lake Otis and Old Seward corridors. Both areas excluded Muldoon Road. The borough contracted with APD to provide service to its police service area, which provided some measure of consistency, but still there were different laws. When unification occurred, both areas formed the core of the municipality's police service area, which expanded over time. The current boundaries date mostly to the early 1990s and the protracted, controversial issue of annexing Basher and the Hillside, also in response to AST's threats to pull out of those areas.",0
"I suspect if you interviewed teachers you would see a different view. You, author, are an exception to the rule, not the normal. Many teachers deal with parents who don't care.

""Well, he didn't learn that d*** language at home,"" ""I've never seen him behave that way,"" ""My kid would never do that,"" ""you're asking too much of him,"" etc. Teachers deal with verbal abuse from parents who don't believe the teacher, even when the teacher spends more time in the week with their kid than they do. Parent's want to think their child is perfect and when they aren't then it must, of course, be a failing of the school system, the teachers, or their environment and while that may be true in some cases the majority is because parents don't care enough to navigate their child's life or to teach them outside of school.",0

Matt. 25 does not take priority over everything else that Our Lord said. Typically, with NCR fans, they quote Jesus for Matt. 25, but for some of His other words and actions, the ones that contradict the leftist view of Him, are ignored or dismissed as ""not probably said by Jesus"".

"Yes Canada could get caught in the crossfire but only if the Canadian Government screws up.  The simple fact is -- Canada may have a merchandise trade surplus with the USA (greater when the price of oil is high) however the overall trade deficit with the USA is a deficit for Canada when you include services and tourism.  i.e. Canadian tourists spend far more in the USA than Americans do in Canada.

In one, police fail in competency and fairness, and the result is a dead civilian who should not have been shot by cops. 

The other is where a cop is shot dead by a violent felon intent on quickly slaughtering cops. Both situations are newsworthy. 

Hello G&M editors, why so much main-page emphasis and prominence in this paper on only the first situation? 

Earlier this month, a New York cop named Familia, who was a mother of three, was assassinated, shot in the head in an event of such prominence that the Governor became involved, making top headlines across the USA. The G&M buried their small amount of reporting inside the World News section, no seeking of a back and forth commentary on the board.

Since human beings have introduced so many wonderful and useful things, it is understandable that there is a push to DO SOMETHING, even if only symbolic, even if the cause-result is imperfectly known.  I think that we can agree that there have been two snowball earths, and that the pre-Nebraskan (AKA pre Illinoisian) glacier period was about 1.8 billion years ago.

"Kinda busy right now.  But the real context is this: the Islamic Republic of Iran dismantled its nuclear weapons program when it dismantled the Shah Pah'lavi regime.  It's chief jurists have repeatedly ruled that developing, possessing or using nuclear weapons of mass destruction is hara'am--Islamically unlawful.  They demonstrated--through the ruling of Imam al-Khomeini (may Allah be pleased with him) their adherence to said rulings by REFUSING to respond in kind against Ba'athist Iraq when they used chemical WMD's which murdered nearly a million of their citizens.

The Zionist entity has, on the other hand, REPEATEDLY threatened their neighbors, the capitals of Europe, the Russians and by extension the WORLD with nuclear winter since at least 1973.  So Clinton and her ilk threaten Iran over nukes it doesn't HAVE while ignoring the REAL nuclear threat in the middle-east.  I can provide you QUOTES of these threats from G. Meir down to A.

I've yet to read of a single incident of a traffic accident being caused by someone passing spare change to a panhandler.  I've yet to read of a single incident of a panhandler being struck by a vehicle.

If you follow the ""traffic safety"" logic, Springfield should make it completely illegal for pedestrians to cross main street.  Why don't you tally the number killed crossing that street and compare it to the number of panhandlers struck by vehicles.

The proposed ban is, indeed, that ""end run"" I suggest.  I don't expect the City or any supporters of the ban to acknowledge this (although a few posters on this site have done so).   I don't expect the Police Chief to acknowledge it.  I don't expect the City Council to acknowledge it.  I don't expect Springfield's attorneys to acknowledge it",0
"This just represents a continuation of Federal policy when it comes to the no-questions-asked inflow of overseas money.

Why else would the Feds just give back, with a small fine, undeclared cash caught at the border, as long as you have an ""explanation"".

Violence.  Too many people are getting hurt and/or dying from it.  I haven't heard of any school teaching anger management.  I have seen a lot of adults being told by the court to attend.  I would say it's a pretty basic need, and given the high rate of violence, I was hoping we could do something in society to help alleviate it.  Instead, society (or the media, at least) tends to label each type of violence.  It all comes from emotion.  I would think a class helping people to manage their emotions better would be beneficial to everyone.

He was asked specifically about an interest rate hike in the Q&A session (at the 36-minute mark of the videotape) and was studiously neutral in his reply.

In regard to Southwest coming to Hawaii, there was a lot of noise a few weeks back when SWA sponsored a tourism forum here in Honolulu. It was thought the event was the calling card in which they'd announce service to the islands either during or soon after. Obviously the announcement didn't happen there. I wonder if in further talks with DOT-A and looking at the operational landscape of HNL, OGG and LIH (the three airports I would suspect would receive service off the bat) whether they decided to wait out a bit while DOT-A figures out how to house SWA in HNL with the volume they want to bring to the islands. Foreman is right, if they bring one plane a day here, it isn't going to change fares much.

After his tax cuts, the economy rebounded and by 1989 was back down to 5.3%. Inflation in 1980 was 13.8%, fell to 3.2% by 1983 and stayed low, finally ending at 4.1% in 1988, Real Median family income rose $4,000 annually by 1988. Prior to the tax cuts in 1981, receipts from income taxes alone totaled 244.1 billion, by 1989, receipts totaled 445.7 billion, an 82% jump. The unemployment for blacks was at 19.2% when Reagan took office and dropped to 11.4% by 1989.

1) The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!
2) This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
3) Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
4) Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - ""The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is"" Very serious situation for USA
5) Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?
6) The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ""intelligence"" like candy. Very un-American!",0

"We bought a VW Touareg TDI in 2014 as a boat hauler, but my wife and I now use the car a lot, it is a wonderful car to drive around in as well as tour.  Of course the VW Diesel Gate has put a wrench in our plan. We bought the middle package and when we  went back to VW to trade the  Touareg for a new 2017 with the advanced  driving abilities like dynamic cruise control we found out that  VW has killed the VW TDI Touareg line in North America. If you own a big SUV and this is one, the best way to fuel it is diesel (the diesel consumes  8  L per 100 KMs, while our Lexus IS 350 we have uses 12 L per 100), so needless to say as we will have to look elsewhere. for a diesel powered SUV.

For health care items most expect like dental, vision, hearing/audio, and prescription coverage you pay extra.  Just because you've paid your payroll taxes for Medicare does not mean you pay nothing when you retire.  Only hospitalization is covered.  You don't want to wait until you need hospitalization!

There was a time when those on the far right detested the Plutocrats and their finance capital as they add nothing to a product other then the fact they have all the money.  So the people that sweat and labour receive a pittance, but the money men get 10 000X the benefit. And we now consider this normal.  It is not.

"""Everyone has a right to acquire healthcare. No one has a right to have someone else pay for it.""

Actually, this is not true.  The Emergency Medical and Treatment Labor Act (EMTLA) passed by Congress in 1986 explicitly forbids the denial of care to indigent or uninsured patients based on a lack of ability to pay.  Some may disagree with this law, but it is the law (a law passed by a Republican Senate and signed by a Republican president) and laws give citizens of this country rights.  So those who need emergency services do have a right to have someone else pay for it.

What about non-emergency care?  Some may argue that only emergency care should be provided, but what sense does that make?  Is it wise to have people wait until their condition is grave, so that taxpayers can foot the bill at the point when treatment is most expensive?  If taxpayers must pay for other's healthcare, doesn't government have a duty to minimize taxpayers' obligation?",0

"Congratulations to Zoe for achieving as much as she has in 18 years!
It is so important that schools let students learn at their own pace. It is especially sad when bright students feel hamstrung when often what should be done is to let them see how much they can learn if provided with opportunities.
As a parent, I can definitely relate to this story. My children are intelligent and sometimes felt that school was impeding their desire to learn more quickly than their classmates. It took putting my son in Math classes with students two years older than he was and giving each of my children as many opportunities outside of school as possible. 
My daughter earned 30 college credits while a high school student and then took another 150 credits in four years at college when only 120 credits were required to graduate. She went on to earn a Master's Degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",0
"Too often these days, diversity implies an anti-white racism.

Too often these days, the latent intellectual capital of our students are sidetracked by brainwashing with ideas that at best detract from pursuit of knowledge  and at worst, inculcate a view of the world that is far from objective.

Its unfortunate, because we are turning out students that are woefully incapable of dealing with hard reality.

We saw a similar student eruption in the 1960s and 70s.

These students are now the conservative establishment",0

Trying to reduce life stress helps, but is difficult in today's fast-paced environment.   As you age, different biochemical evolution occur in your body, and this also plays a part in how much sleep you need to feel refreshed.  Thanks for the suggestions!  Cheers.",0

This is true.

565 P.2d 159, reversed. BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. 9-0?
Syllabus; 
Appellants, at least five of whom are not residents of Alaska, challenged in state court the constitutionality of the ""Alaska Hire"" statute (which was enacted professedly for the purpose of reducing unemployment within the State) that requires that all Alaskan oil and gas leases, easements or right-of-way permits for oil and gas pipelines, and unitization agreements contain a requirement that qualified Alaska residents be hired in preference to nonresidents. The trial court upheld the statute. The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed except for that part of the Act that contained a one-year durational residency requirement, which it held invalid.

No, that seems to come from a deep-rooted hatred of the Palestinians, and support for the Israeli far-right and its racist, criminal policies.

Your comment above shows that you know little to nothing about health and what you eat. Your part about meat and when you should eat it is a recipe for Bad health. If you eat X amount of a plant based protein dish your body will digest this in about an hour and take almost all of the protein into your body. If you eat X amount of meat with the same amount of protein your body will digest this for seven to eight hours and take out about twenty five per cent of the protein and express the rest. What this means is vegetable based is far better for you then meat based plus giving your stomach a rest. A large supper and small other meals also goes against every thing we know about nutrition.,0

1. Coaches such as Shanahan & Belichick had a proven track record of being successful coordinators (unlike VJ).  So when they struggle, you can point to their past successes leading a unit.  
2. Several rookie coaches are thriving- Buffalo, Rams.  Even coaches with QB issues are getting more out of their teams (Indy, Houston, Chicago, Minn).  Not having prior coordinator experience is seriously hurting VJ.  He has no clue how to control the momentum of the game.
3. This team has got serious issues with fundamentals - penalties, fumbles, special teams coverages etc.  That is a direct reflection of coaching.
4. Improvement through the year - Sometimes teams start slow & they get better as the season goes along.  Example:  Dallas.  Steady improvement since blowout in Denver.  That is a reflection of coaching and player development.  We are going in the opposite direction.
This Broncos team has issues.  But they are not 51-23 bad. That is on the coach.",0

"I am having great difficulty understanding the glaring contradictions associated with this whole controversy. On the one hand it seems to be acceptable and even fashionable to try to erase from our public space those symbols that represent people or practices of repression in our distant and not too distant history. As a society we appear to be attempting to sanitize our language and are even prepared to jail offenders who do not adhere to what the police of political correctness mandate as acceptable or not acceptable. Allegedly, we are doing this as a society because of what those symbols or historical persons or entities or hurtful language represent to some members of our society. In other words a minority of people who object to playing by the new rules can be demonized, sanctioned or jailed for not conforming. Why is it then acceptable and defensible to allow these articles of clothing that also represent oppression and tyranny the freedom to offend? These are not religious items",0

"""So what's the answer? There isn't one, at least if we're looking for the answer in biology. We must not fall back on biology.""

Rather, the vast majority of people - both in academy and in the laity - recognize that sex is primarily and enormously genetic. It's regretful that so many people don't understand the genetics, but this is no excuse to force comprehension to an emotional, rather than rational, standard. 

""Rather, we must always remember that it is we, not biology, who decide who counts as male or female.""

This is demonstrably false. Biology is responsible for the majority of this 'decision', as the author rather poorly puts it. I think the author means to say that where individuals seek to deviate from this standard, we are obliged to accept their choice. The author needs to be considerably more careful in his demands for a reasonable ethical standard that he does not put his foot over the line of his comprehension.

If that person does not like it, or anyone else for that matter, there are thousands of Protestant sects they can join--churches that will teach the secular Gospel they have embraced.",0
"I'm glad you posted Bill.  You've got quite the sense of humor. Or were you serious? 
Anyway, why don't you tell me how many people reside in those those 3,084 counties/parishes/boroughs, then break the numbers down by how many voted for Trump. Then we can do the same for the 57 states/counties/parishes/boroughs that Clinton won. And what do you think we'll find? That's right:  that's 2.9 million more people who voted for Clinton over Trump.  

Two point nine MILLION MORE people.  Gee, sounds significant to me. Almost like that person should be President because, after all, they won in reality. 

I was hoping you'd get the point in my first reply, but I see you still don't understand basic math when it comes to actual people voting as opposed to areas where people reside. You know, the same way the Supreme Court can say corporations are people, but everyone knows they're really not, that saying they're people just a another sleazy Republican device to game the system.",0

Yet Scalia protected the rights of flag burners, Kennedy saved Roe & legalized gay marriage, & Roberts saved Obamacare. At this point, I really don't know what liberals have to complain about from GOP nominees.

As for the charade of these nominations, I'm fine with punishing McConnell, but let's not forget that it was Joe Biden & Ted Kennedy who made these hearings the truly appalling events that they are. It's time to go back to the old method: end the hearing charade. If you complain about the campaign-esque fundraising that now occurs (for nominees of both parties, Sen. Whitehouse), then end the campaign-esque features of the process. I'll won't hold my breath.",0

Also second is the same war the feminist groups are waging against the male elite is adding to it fear and even paranoia of males in general including perspective male teachers. This begins in the college of education with more outright suspicion and hurtful professors and teachers who as a group and more isolated from males in education have come to distrust and even hold out more immediate derision of  male teachers in general. All you have to do is be in a classroom to feel the extra harshness even more meanness male students experience in the classroom with only exception being the middle class Male students who are given more respect in view of  more parental support.,0

"""White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. As The Post noted in a new analysis published last week, that means black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers.

U.S. police officers have shot and killed the exact same number of unarmed white people as they have unarmed black people: 50 each. But because the white population is approximately five times larger than the black population, that means unarmed black Americans were five times as likely as unarmed white Americans to be shot and killed by a police officer.""

Chief Justice of Canada Brian Dickson thought differently, Jason:
 
""the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty requires, at a minimum, that: (1) an individual be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the State must bear the burden of proof; and (3) criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with lawful procedures and fairness.""

"Great rivalry? Hardly. 

And our man DeGrasse says as much himself. From an article in yesterday's Globe:

"" 'It’s not a rivalry,' Mr. De Grasse told Britain’s Daily Mail this week. 'He has dominated for so long. I’ve still not beaten him – but I’d love to. To have a rivalry, you have to have a back and forth. He is on his way out and a veteran. I’m trying to prove myself.' ""

Your ironic point about an internal conversion has been at the heart of much of what this scandal has been about for me all along.  The church teaches that sacraments are outward signs of inward grace.  It calls us all to an internal transformation, conversion, and all of the other gifts of the spirit.  And yet, those who lead the church continue to refuse to adopt the much needed outward sign of an inward change of their own hearts when it comes to the scandal.  They've tried words, and that's part of the problem: all too often those words led to no change.  So we no longer trust those words.

That it took bad press and near universal outrage to get them to move at all should cause the bishops to pause and do some serious, reflection.  That we've seen so little of accountability suggests that inward change has yet to happen.

The 2% figure is probably a little low now, although it depends on what assumptions you apply.  From RTD's website ( http://www.rtd-denver.com/factsAndFigures.shtml ) there's 2.92 million people in the district and 329k average weekday boardings.  What's tricky is translating boardings into unique passengers.  The average rider would make at least 2 boardings per day (round trip commute).  Presumably transfers count too, thus someone taking a bus to the train would count for 4 boardings per day.  Some could even have 6, or more.  But I would guess the lion's share are people that make between 2 and 4 boardings per day, so let's say 3 for a reasonable average.  329k / 2.92M / 3 = 3.8%.

Because there are many more nonhunters than hunters (even in Alaska, but especially nationally) and both pay income tax, which is used to fund wildlife-related work in many agencies (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, BLM, National Park Service), a comprehensive estimate of who pays for wildlife clearly showed it is nonhunters. Most Pittman-Robertson funds are from the sale of guns and ammunition, including a huge proportion used for nonhunting purposes. Because hunters pay license and tag fees, in addition to Pittman-Robertson taxes, the average hunter pays more than the average nonhunter for wildlife management, but because so few Americans are hunters and even many hunters don't hunt or buy guns and ammo every year, nonhunters as a group pay far more for wildlife management.",0

That is referring to an almost 100% full democrat control in Hawaii for more than 50 years, yes?  Worst homeless rate, worst schools, worst cost of housing, worst project cost overruns, worst tax system. the ONLY GET tax in the country, taxing food, taxing medicine, taxing everything multiple times. I bet if they could pull it off they would tax air too.

Yes, i agree. this environment of one party full control is completely poisonous.

But i hope that Gove Ige does well and presses point that Hawaii is in fact Unique and still needs help in spite of the fact that we are often self sabotaging.  While homelessness may be down in the rest of the country, it is up here. That needs to take a good hard and HONEST look as to why that is (see first paragraph).  But hopefully is the new Administration does cut funding for homeless services, they can carve out an exception for Hawaii because we need it.",0

He was confused by being abandoned and goes looking for her.  His efforts to simply find out what  happened to the woman he loves  are presented as the utmost in male callousness. Atwood is deep into the female suffering but can't actually explain it: we are simply expected to take it on faith that he was a creep.

I find it amusing that there are so many in Hawaii who are still thinking that Obama is a ""local"" boy and we should love him and what he did and does no matter if it is/was wrong or right for the majority of Americans.

It seems to me the goal of the new policy is to have the proceeds of the company taxed in Marie's hands and not split between her and her son (or any other person that made a nominal contribution), and there will no longer be an incentive to issue company shares for nominal contributions.

"Mr Mason, I fail to see why you're so agitated. I see no leftist angle, no attempt to justify the terrible actions of a few these last several days. I do see a discussion of the fact that Portland, like any other city, has a past marked by racial discrimination, and thus we should acknowledge the historical basis for the anger we've seen of late. As the article notes, Oregon was established in the 19th century as a whites-only territory. Red-lining, which occurred until the 1950s and prevented people of color from buying homes in certain neighborhoods, has left a legacy where inherited wealth skews overwhelmingly to whites. And let's not forget about Vanport (which almost everyone has). The point is that racial discrimination is never a thing of the past. It's not a problem we've solved, and now let's just get over it. It lingers and simmers and reaches us in the present. Isn't that worth knowing? Doesn't any solution in the present depend on an honest acknowledgment of the past?",0
"It should be debated, because it's a nuanced issue. I'm surprised at how many responses veer all the way in the opposite direction. Of course appropriation does exist; consider the white college girls who use indigenous war bonnets as trendy, pseudo-bohemian accessories. That's an important ceremonial item, and it's obviously disrespectful to re-purpose it as something trivial. That's cultural appropriation. Playing with random bits and pieces of other people's religions, customs, and lives is rude at best,.

That being said, this backlash is so disproportionate, it's embarrassing.  It's clear that Niedzviecki was using the term very loosely, and didn't understand its complexities. These reactions seem to take isolated sentences at face value; in context, they're a non-issue. Unfortunately, this type of over-reaction just perpetuates the idea that anyone concerned about racial issues is silly and oversensitive.",0

"A LOT less (and less hot) than present.

Which is why: NASA, NOAA Data Show 2016 Warmest Year on Record Globally

2016 is remarkably the third record year in a row in this series,” said GISS Director Gavin Schmidt. “We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear.”

ost of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year – from January through September, with the exception of June – were the warmest on record for those respective months. October, November, and December of 2016 were the second warmest of those months on record – in all three cases, behind records set in 2015.

Instead, the butt of the joke were really young trad priests.  I generally agree that repeating the joke was ill conceived.

No such rule exists, which the IRS confirmed, but even that was unnecessary since we all know Trump can release his own records if he wishes, or not. So even if Trump said such a thing, it would therefore carry the proper meaning that he ""won't"" release his tax records because it would not be in his own interests to do so, not that it would be illegal. Therefore, the liberal press has simply attempted to manufacture something they can call a lie, which is in itself a lie, and you bought it. Even so, Trump, like Obama and Hillary and anyone running for or holding office, says slippery or imprecise things that can have multiple meanings, in this case regarding releasing his taxes, precisely so he cannot easily be held to anything.

"""... a theological college which confers a Degree in Theology....""

Interesting you raise that point, Red chook! Religious/monastic orders -- with their rule of celibacy -- have theological colleges of their own for their own seminarians (Jesuits at Jesuit universities, Franciscans at their universities, Holy Cross Fathers at theirs [Notre Dame], etc.) but bishops prefer to have their diocesan candidates study at their own diocesan seminaries. Not sure why, but that is the way it is. (Maybe the theological programs at Catholic universities are too liberal? Not sure.)

And of course, Francis has already proposed ordaining married men to the priesthood to National Conferences of Bishops the world over, but our Bishops don't want to go that route. You figure!!!! 
Maybe they feel that it's enough that they have to put up with married clerics of Eastern Catholic Churches, married convert clerics (formerly Protestant), and married Ordinariate priests, they don't need to contend with more.",0

It's these investments that have made life so comfortable for humans and denying this is denying reality. Yes, hydrocarbons are finite, but they are not very scarce.

"Most likely, PF would agree that our moral shortcomings are indeed sinful behavior.  We are ALL guilty of sin, and it is incumbent upon each of us to seek the requisite forgiveness. The pivotal question here is, how are we to respond to our sinful brethren? 

The answer to this question MUST stem from the realization of our own sinfulness, and how it must feel to insist that the marginalized parties (irregular unions, for example) have ZERO hope of being fully accepted into sacramental life. This despite their own sincere efforts to repent and reconcile of their ""irregular"" situation. Do we read their hearts and presumptuously condemn their sincerity, or do we treat them as we would like to be treated? 

Doctrinal purists would have them live as brother and sister (a nonsensical and bogus argument if there ever was one), or just ""suck it up"" and accept that they are to remain unworthy, second class citizens in the eyes of certain Roman prelates (notice I didn't say in the eyes of God).",0

Just this past Thursday, about 9 months after Trump made his MAJOR announcement about all his MAGA promises coming true, Carrier started laying off staff. Over 300 staff were laid off as jobs began being outsourced to Mexico, exactly as planned before the Orange Buffoon tried to 'fix the deal'.

"Dean, yes there are equal rights laws, yet we still are a long way from equal rights for everybody.  The 14th amendment required equal rights for all.  That didn't begin to materialize until the late 60's.  Affirmative Action was one of those laws.  Johnson's reasoning for that law was like this - When for generations I have kept my neighbor down, I have to now help him up.  Unfortunately, that remains true today.  I recently read an article about a town in Tennessee that voted to split its school district into two so that the more affluent whites could keep blacks out of their schools and keep their tax money from the black schools - white affirmative action.  It is easy to say that we solved all the problems with the civil rights legislation of the '60's, but looking at what's happening that is not the case.

Do you understand why nationalism is dangerous? Nationalism and patriotism aren't the same thing. Nationalism allows for an ""us vs them"" narrative which is horrid in a democracy based on a variety of cultures and ideas like ours is.

Take a step back and look at what this article is about. There are people who disagree with a political policy and are gathering peacefully. The majority of comments are essentially painting them as either a. cry babies, or b. violent criminals. Surely there is a sentiment that people who oppose Trump's policies are somehow ""un American"" and anti ""America first"". In reality anyone who gathers peacefully and rallies around their political ideals is patriotic and American. This includes people who gather and support Trump.

Things that are anti free speech, anti freedom of the press, anti religious freedom, anti other cultures, etc are un-American. Creating nationalistic dichotomies is dangerous.",0

Now it appears that although he does have bots following him (as does Obama, I'm sure) there has been no surge in the number of his followers recently, bot or not.

Here's the answer: because the role of the state in a democracy, however mediocre and dysfunctional the institutions of that democracy might be, is to promote the welfare of the general public. Voting is a public good. Automatically registering citizens to vote does no harm. The state should make it as easy as possible for citizens to participate in elections. As citizens participate more, they will see the wisdom of informing themselves on the issues. This is exactly what anti-voting rights people fear.

That capacity is also spread across the entire Provinces generation system and not readily or easily routed to where demand is needed. Which is why many areas of the Province get their power from the U.S., Manitoba and Quebec, and vice versa. What happens if EVs are charging overnight in the U.S., Manitoba and Quebec?

They don't deliver 'better' healthcare when you look at the actual healthcare provided the provide 'free' healthcare that has minimally better results at a massive social cost.  You can't really sue the government when it screws you over you just die or get to live with the incorrect result.

Most try to portray that as profit and the rest ignore the fact that the 'administrative costs' frequently include all the administrative costs that are not covered by medicaid and medicare and pushed off onto the rest of the healthcare insurance payers. Of course it also includes all the requirements of the various exchanges in providing information that is at best redundant.

The same idea of benevolence needs to be applied to those who have invested their lives resources into building homes in the valley long before the racers came along.

That is why I an thankful for the zoning laws that protect our homes from outside interests developing uses on neighboring lands that are incompatible with the surrounding lands.

First I would say people believe they would have to accept a really bad doctor. They know their doctor now, have a relationship, and think this cannot be replicated if they get an assigned doctor. Yet the problem is comparing a relationship that one has with one may have. It could be that an assigned doctor would be even better than one's current doctor. But we don't have any information about the unknown relationship so fear it. That may be normal human behavior, but it's not very rational.
It also assumes bad doctors would be more of problem with UHC. Maybe so. But wouldn't people have an option to rate doctors? Doctors would still be subject to board regulators.

"One of the looming issues is that there are about 300,000 retired Brits living in Spain and Portugal because of the cheaper costs of living. Once Brexit happens they will have no access to EU country funded health care unless they buy private care ( probably unaffordable or unavailable due to pre-existing conditions). That means they move back to the UK ( look out property values in Spain and Portugal) to access health care, or they go without ( where many will inevitably find out the real personal financial costs of falling sick in another country who has no obligation to fund your emergency medical needs) So the refrain will more commonly be heard...

"You get the prize for most cliches in a post.   Congratulations, you are now deemed fit to run for parliament.

Immigration creates 80+% of the demand for new additional housing units in Canada.  In the major cities, immigration is responsible for 100% of the additional demand because there is a net outflow of Canadians from those cities.  If interest rates were the prime driver instead of demand, housing prices would be the same across the country.   So a nice house and lot would cost $1.4 million in Elliot Lake, just as in Toronto.   But the price in Elliot Lake is closer to $110,000.  Demand drives the market.

There are studies relating surplus labour to stagnant and declining wages.  Try google instead of the corporate media.

Adding an additional City of Toronto every 7 years to the Canadian landscape basically defines negative environmental impact.  How much more negative can it get than paving over prime farmland and increasing ghg emissions?

"""Fee and dividend"" applies market forces to shape energy strategies in a world where man-made climate change is the single worst threat to the human future.  Currently, the fossil fuel market assumes that producers and consumers can use the atmosphere as a free-of-charge waste disposal site, with no consequences, or, at least relatively few beyond those the Clean Air Act set out to rectify.

In other words, the terrible cost of greenhouse gas emissions--climate disruption, broadening disease vectors, rising seas, ocean acidification--is not reflected in the ""price at the pump"". Fee and dividend would impose a regular, quantifiable cost to carbon pollution, thus levelling the playing field with clean energy technology that doesn't use our air as waste dump. 

The other advantage of fee and dividend over taxes and regulations is that the fee schedule is straightforward and universally applied. Producers could predict, exactly,  how the fee would affect their costs.",0

- H.L. Mencken, On Politics: A Carnival of Buncombe

American democracy truly is an oxymoron.

More than ever, the US's system of government must be described as an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery which has arisen largely due to negligence on the part of a highly partisan press.

Doubtful that the minority of Americans who voted for Trump could form a post without including some smear about ""lefties"" or Hillary's ""pant suit.""

"The Holy Spirit speaks to everyone - man or woman, adult or child, any color, any faith.  Our mistake is in thinking that only the magisterium can hear Her, understand Her, and make known what She brings into the world.  There is much we can learn about God's presence through how people of other faiths have listened.  

The Spirit of Catholicism is open to discernment, to listening.  The problem with the surprises of the Spirit is that old fuddy-duddies only listen to what they want to hear and many are not open to the Surprises of the Spirit.  I think many Catholics do understand that - which is why majorities of Catholics in many nations do things like vote for gay marriage or ignore what the fuddy-duddies say on a number of issues.  

They are still Catholics, just discerning, listening Catholics.",0

A very few houses might trade, but their average selling price is not representative of the market. If more houses sold, they’d need to accept a lower price. Since sellers refused to budge, that lower price remains undiscovered. That doesn’t mean the prices of homes hadn’t dropped. It just remained unknown.

I've often wondered if that name is used by more than one person - all of them rabidly conservative Trump supporters. Or maybe Russians - or college students paid to post.

"@Josie28: That makes the BC Liberals 6-fold hypocrites for opposing similar measures before. 

I understand the tactical reasons for going this route - they already got a post-election corporate donor infusion and this will (relatively) hobble their opponents fundraising in the next immediate election, they can (try to) brand their opponents as hypocrites for opposing their own proposals, they can claim to be listening to the will of BCers, etc. 

The political tactics are sound and it is their prerogative to make this move. But the hypocrite/ listening to citizens line? That dog won't hunt monsignor. It will give existing supporters something to sound off about, but I have a hard time seeing this last second flurry of activity swaying the people they lost in the most recent election that they've changed.

Actually Paul is speaking directly to the question of how to achieve equality in Christ.  But the method he espouses is radical to the human spirit.

The way to strive for equality, according to Paul?  We should each empty ourselves and adopt the attitude of a Servant.  We should esteem our fellow believers Higher than Ourselves.

If we all did that, there would indeed be the equality in the Body of Christ that Paul describes in Galatians 3:28.

And then James explains why the believers of his day, and of ours, fail to achieve this ideal.  It is because of our selfish desires for dominance and power and gratification.

Yet no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how young the victims, no matter how much fear is engendered in a community, no matter how much media attention and public discussion the crimes of whites engender, the race itself is never sullied."" 

Lisa Bloom also says white men are at the top of the list for gaining foreign visas to have sex with children. 85-percent in Latin America, she says.

Lisa Bloom also adds the most prolific serial killers in this country (America) are white men. And last, white women are known for killing their children.

"""This is so because no matter what the liturgy looks and sounds like, the Mass is still the Mass, and the church is still the church I love. I will never give up on the Mass, and I will never give up on the church, imperfect and frequently unsatisfactory as they both are, and like I am.""

"Seattle has a benign climate, with breathtaking summers, and mild winters.  It is a globally acknowledged tech hub, with hundreds of small startups, in addition to goliaths like Microsoft and Amazon.  There is NO state income tax, the top tax bracket of 39.6% applies to singles with incomes of $418,400/couples $470,400US.  The City of Seattle (not affecting the suburbs) just assessed a further 2.25% on incomes in excess of $250,000.  Electricity is priced competitively, and is abundant.  Their sports teams have tasted success since Al Gore invented the internet.

BUT, its housing is unaffordable and getting worse, the cost of living is high relative to other jurisdictions, and its roads and bridges are clogged with traffic.

Amazon is looking to establish a second, centre of gravity, in a metropolitan area that offers the good parts of the Seattle equation, without the bad stuff.

"Thanks for the link to The Hill, it had some decent information not only about the Steele dossier but also about Prevezon real estate management company, which I posted about on this forum about a month or so ago. Prevezon is a firm licensed in Malta, IIRC, that laundered stolen taxes from Russia through purchasing New York real estate. It was under investigation by the US attorney's office. Prevezon's lawyer went to Trump Tower to meet with Jared Kushner, Don Trump Jr and a couple of others to talk about the Magnitsky Act, but as Prevezon's attorney she most certainly wanted the US case against the Prevezon money laundering  dropped in exchange for something as yet unknown. One of Trump's first acts in office was to fire that US attorney and drop the lawsuit, which was settled for a pittance.

The Hill supports the Slate and others, that the RNC first bought the Steele dossier but didn't use it when Trump clinched the nomination. DNC bought it but never used it.",0
"Robalta, your attempt at rebuttal is not compelling, and disappoints.

Parents have allowed their children to be ""sacrificed"" in all decades including the most recent one. That is what wars are between nations. Canada has had its soldiers fighting on the front lines routinely over the past hundred years. The parents sent them on their way, those kids of theirs, with a nice family photo to carry in their wallet. They were slaughtered from France to Germany to Korea to Afghanistan, in brutal fashion, bullets through skulls, knives through chests, that sort of thing.

And yes, there are redeeming features to such sacrifices of life: We destroy Hitler's movement, for example. Pacifist arguments fail when faced with 1940s Germany. There was no moral bankruptcy in fighting Germany then.

You have failed to demonstrate any moral bankruptcy in the setting in which you claim it existed. And you changed subjects, from vicarious redemption being offensive to killing children being offensive.",0

Well, I'm not sure how  clearer I can make this, but, yet once again, the US CDC has estimated that of the total fluoride intake from all sources, 75% is from water and beverages.  Knowing how much fluoridated water and soda I consumed today makes determining my total fluoride intake easy.  
.

Given that I have been drinking optimally fluoridated nearly exclusively for the past 45-50 years, with no valid evidence of any adverse effects, whatsoever, I have no reason to doubt the validity of the CDC estimation.  Given that in the 72 year history of fluoridation, there have been no proven adverse effects, there is no reason to doubt the validity of the CDC estimation for anyone.

Sure I drink sodas, predominantly sugar-free, some days more than others.  Given that I don't drink alcohol, smoke, do drugs, or any other such self-destructive habits, I'm fine with drinking a liter of soda here and there.

No one can force travelers to shower and work the dreaded swing shift for 30 years, or force someone to put down the beer and get to work by 7am every f'n day. 
We do not have the right to insist that someone else's kids do their homework, be attentive in class, read for one hour every day instead of playing e-games or watching TV. We can't force people to feed their kids fresh vegetables and go hiking. I feel really bad for the children, but adults do have the right to make choices for themselves.",0

In the recent EO TRO, there was nothing about the extent of US vetting process that justified the TRO except what Trump said in 2015 and nothing about what exactly did the AG figured out what was going on.

"When there's a 'bang' on or near a fireworks holiday,
it is a considered opinion of mine and people I know
that the noise could be gunfire. Even 10 or 20 bangs
in a row... of exactly the same caliber.

When there's scofflaws on the streets, I'm careful to 
not get in the cross-fire; to confront the authors of
the noise, thinking they're using illegal fireworks,
can get you shot. Even if noises at first were fireworks!

Started two days ago; not knowing what the noise was
I didn't call it in. The police usually show up to ask 
where the sound was coming from. Tonight, I can't get 
the police; it sounds like a small battle near Dowling/66th.

Good points but lets look at the other side of the coin here. The veterans as you mention have been to the top. They know what it takes and they should also know that luck also has a very real presence. Manning's Super Bowl ring has luck written all over it in my opinion. That team caught all the breaks all season long. I am a believer that teams and players can influence luck by being disciplined as well as humble and hungry for more. Nothing humble about the Bronco defense. Members have been flapping their yaps for a long time.  Not a good thing to do in the NFL as the hungry teams will end up making you eat your words sooner or later. I think that's whats happening and the team leaders are rolling over at an alarming rate. Lot's of blame and the only way to heal that is for the leaders of this team stand up and fight for the right to be a Bronco. That's what I want to see.,0

"Man Ravaged by Amnesia Somehow Able to Hold Down Demanding Legal Job

""An Alabama man whose brain was ravaged by severe amnesia is somehow able to function in an extremely demanding legal job, leading neurologists reported on Tuesday.""

""The man, whom neurologists are calling a “medical mystery,” has performed highly exacting tasks in one of the country’s top legal positions despite having virtually no short- or long-term memory.""

""Dr. Davis Logsdon, the chairman of the neurology department at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said that the Alabaman’s brain “defies explanation.”

“In all the medical literature, we have never seen an example of someone capable of holding down such a high-powered job while having no memory whatsoever of people he met, things he said, places he has been, or thoughts he has had,” Logsdon said. “It’s the stuff of science fiction.""

Three intelligence sources told The Daily Beast that the ban on carry-on electronica aboard U.S. -bound flights from 10 airports in North Africa and the Middle East was the result of information seized during the U.S. raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen in January, the raid Trump’s critics claimed was a failure.  Information from the raid shows Al Qaeda successfully developed compact, battery bombs that fit inside laptops or other devices that may be strong enough to bring down an aircraft. The battery bombs would need to be manually triggered, which is why the electronics ban is only for the aircraft cabin and not for checked luggage.  Good job, Trump.

Step two then, is to examine how those points of view are instilled in children and youth as they develop.  In many many cases they are taught those attitudes inter-generationally.

Almost all the wind plans are in the W Cape and E Cape - where it is generally windy. Thus if the wind is not blowing in those 2 provinces, no wind energy is generated.

But let's ignore the above and use your statement that we average ""less than 2 windless nights PER YEAR"". Hell, let's just make it one windless night per year! What do you propose we do on that night? Will we need a huge investment in gas turbines equal to our wind turbine capacity to be ready and waiting to work for just that one night every year? How much do you think that will cost? 

That is the crux of the problem: you need an additional backup system to operate on the windless night. You don't need this with baseload/dispatchable power as there is almost no chance that every nuclear/coal/gas power station will simultaneously fail.",0

I recently read about the heat pumps at the Sealife Center in Seward that use energy from the ocean and provide nearly all the heating needs for the center. The costs were roughly a half million but a grant covered most of it. The majority of the University locations are on the ocean coast. I would imagine that the total costs could be fully covered from grants and individual or corporate doantions.

The high cost of electricity is another expense that could be substantially reduced if not eliminated after start up expenses for alternate energy sources. Aggressively using grants and donations to significantly reduce to costs and selling off excess electricity in the summer for credits toward winter usage.

My final suggestion would be to closely examine the costs associated with the top tier of employees at the university for unnecessary perks and expenses",0

Do the operators of PV and turbines have a similar regulation - or can they simply leave then where they are to rust away?

Operation Mockingbird is a classic example of this practice of manipulating perceptions. From the master himself, Goebbels, ""The best propaganda is that which, as it were, works invisibly, penetrates the whole of life without the public having any knowledge of the propagandistic initiative.""
""Manchurian Candidate""
The meme that Trump is a communist Russian agent, even though the communist state has perished, is an often repeated silliness. Goebbels once said that repeating an outrageous lie enough times and people will believe it.
Sophisticated technology makes the sinister manipulation of public perceptions much easier today, and will even be worse in the future for consumers of information ...Joseppi",0

Absent corroborating evidence, the correct way to report this matter is that the prisoner ALLEGES she was pepper sprayed in a Chinese prison. This is how it would be reported if it happened in Canada. Instead, the author ASSERTS that Chinese authorities mistreated the prisoner based solely on the prisoner's own statement. This is biased reporting of a kind that's all-too common in today's MSM. An allegation is printed as fact, and then picked up and repeated by numerous other media outlets.

I don't doubt that conditions in Chinese prisons are tough. And I condemn the abuse of prisoners wherever it might happen, especially in Canada. But reporting a prisoner's complaint as a fact when such hasn't been established is poor journalism. .",0

"A post below suggests that ""Truly healthy people typically respond to diverse situations, not with fear and instability, but with a calm commitment to their values"". Without parsing the statement it might be asked:
-is it only the ""(t)ruly healthy"" who so respond?
-who are the ""(t)ruly healthy""?
-does ""calm commitment to their values"" presuppose that these values are compatible with our notion of that is ""good"", whether individual or common?""
""Instability"" can be seen as the opportunity which was capitalized upon by D.J.Trump, family and associates. One can reasonably ask whether the values of this coterie are ""typical"", the ""good""- common or otherwise - or of a ""truly healthy person"", nation, espoused faith, politics that sustains him.

In May of 2009  Arlen Specter switched parties, giving the Dems the 60 votes they needed to pass legislation, provided they could get 58 Democrats and two independents to agree.

In August Ted Kennedy died, and his seat was won in a special election by Scott Brown, who took his seat in February 4, 2010.

Orthodox Catholics are however, realists. They realise that God is absolutely just as well as absolutely merciful. It is not easy to see how absolute justice and mercy can be exercised simultaneously, only God Himself knows that. 
What we do know however, is that Christ said loving God necessitates keeping His Commandments, all of them as they relate both to Him and our neighbour. The heterodox look for loopholes in them, ways of getting around them, and create for themselves a warm, fuzzy, comfortable religion where sin and self-sacrifice no longer exist with a God who benignly tolerates their rejection of His Laws and Commandments.

"This was not a murder conviction as understood anywhere except the bizarre and twisted US military commission tribunal in Guantanamo. 

It was years later the US invented a crime that did not exist heretofore and exists nowhere else in civil criminal, military or international law .  We have laws prohibiting convictions  'ex post facto' crimes - see the Charter at S. 11(g) as does the US (clause 3 of Article I, Section 9 of the US Constitution) and it is the basis under which a number of Gitmo convictions have already been overturned.  Khadr's appeal has yet to be heard as the US is using every preocedural delay.

After the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was signed in October 2006, new charges were sworn against Khadr on February 2, 2007. He was charged with Murder in Violation of the Law of War - a wholly US invented crime that did not exist before 2006 and is not recognized anywhere else in the world.

"The reality is that in fact, some religions are more compatible with democracy than others. Unfortunately too many people are totally ignorant of those differences because they have just lumped them all together as nonsense, and never enquired further.
 
Sikhism is actually one of the more compatible ones. While preaching a very austere lifestyle for its practitioners, it is very egalitarian and tolerant of other lifestyles and does not seek to convert anyone.  It was, however, created in opposition to Islam and Hinduism, i.e. specifically disapproves of caste and face veiling.

I see no problem with Sikhism.",0
"Correct, because God took the inclusive relationship He had with Adam, and procured from him (his rib) - in order for a whole new order of creation to exist - a woman, Eve. Adam had to give up something of himself (i.e. self giving.) Adam could not live alone (no solitude, no selfish the earth is all mine and I am the only human being to be here.) That is, he was unsuitable to live and dwell with God as the singular human being on earth. So in order for that life and creation to flow, He needed (not as some necessary mechanism as plants or animals do.) In other words, Adam had to ""share"" his life with another: a female, a woman. Meaning, charity had to grow and sponsor through that relationship - Adam could not live without her. In fact, when God forbade him to eat the tree of knowledge, he had to share all that God told him with Eve. And of course, with his children. The out-flowing and pouring relationship, and love of the Holy Trinity (The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.)",0

"This isn't about moral judgements, but about net results. India had 25 percent of the world's economy, and was invaded non stop from Alexander to the British.

There were also famines during British Rule, whereas after independence there were no famines in India.

Easy to say, but harder to put into action, for a variety of historical and political reasons. However, for the right odds I would put a bet on a united Ireland before an independent Scotland.

In Northern Ireland, demographics are inexorably leading to Unionists (Protestants) being in the minority in the next 20 to 30 years, partly due to a higher birth rate amongst the Nationalist (Catholic) population and a higher emigration rate by Protestants (I am an example of that; we left in the late 70s at the height of the Troubles).

There was going to be an increasing clamour for a ""border poll"" in the 10 years ahead. If Brexit turns out to be bad for N/Ireland (re-imposition of a ""hard"" border etc) then the calls for a border poll will only increase.

At $50 oil, the effective tax rate drops down close to 12% under SB21, after deducting the $8 production tax credits, NOT the so called 35% FLAT TAX RATE. However, under SB21 they can recover a carry forward loss at the higher 35% “Flat” tax rate.",0

"You wrote: ""It's time to improve vehicle traffic ..."" Are you suggesting we are not improving vehicular traffic? I drove into town on 30th last night and the new merge system is much safer. And the highway has been repaved.
So if you are suggesting we are not improving our vehicular, I'd say you're misrepresenting  facts.
Curb-outs, speed humps and bike lanes (?) don't intentionally damage vehicles, people do. Have you ever seen a speed bump reach out and attack a vehicle? 
These devices damage vehicles because people are not paying attention or are speeding. Sure, sometimes people's cars are damaged, but it is a lot less of a problem than the damage done to a child's body because people speed. 
Now, a lot of people will call instead for more enforcement (the believers in the ""bad seed""), but that costs money and only works as long as a cop sits on the road. These traffic devices work 24 hours a day, don't have a health/retirement plan and save tax dollars.
So why are you against them?",0

"What I've always found troubling is the arbitrary, bureaucratic requirement that a person needs three times the income to pay the rent.  That requirement immediately disqualifies most of the people making the median income.

The reality of the situation is that a lower income person has to spend more than a third of their income on rent -- on up to pretty close to their entire income on rent and other fixed costs, like food, transportation, clothing.  They don't need to reserve another third of their income for travel, entertainment, gifts, insurance, retirement savings, fine dining, cigarettes and alcohol, etc.   They have to spend every penny on actual basic needs.  Otherwise, you arbitrarily disqualify huge swaths of the population from even being considered from the housing stock.

Sounds like Akima policy allows women to be fired but not male executives.  Quoting from the WaPo article Akima failed to fire a male director who violated company policy:
=====
As she was monitoring Facebook this summer, she found a public comment by a senior director at the company in an otherwise civil discussion by one of his employees about Black Lives Matter.

“You’re a f------ Libtard a------,” the director injected, using his profile that clearly and repeatedly identifies himself as an employee of the firm.

In fact, the person he aimed that comment at was so offended by the intrusion into the conversation and the coarse nature of it that he challenged the director on representing Akima that way.

So Briskman flagged the exchange to senior management.

In 1 Timothy 3:4, 5, when talking of the Bishops, Paul said they were to be rulers in their homes. In Genesis we already saw that the position of ruling was given to the man, not the woman. If he ruled his home well, he could be trusted to rule the church.

The Democrats in the US are as much, and probably more, to blame for this than Republicans and as averse to reform----just look at the number of lawyers in Democratic caucuses and the amount the legal profession donates to Democratic campaigns. The costs aren't restricted to health care---just look at the insane amount ($134 million) awarded to Sergeant Speer's widow in the Khadr case---but certainly are a factor in health care costs, directly because of the number and size of claims increasing insurance costs, and indirectly, because of the added procedures performed to deflect lawsuits.

Why the journey?  The Spirit takes us as we are, including our conceptual limitations.  We struggle to find conceptualizations that are closer to reality.

"A lot of things weren't ""like that 30-40 years ago.""  Including what you call ""police surveillance"". (ugly term)--we used to call it ""patrol.""  But some things never change. 

Didn't see the police much growing up in Vernon, B.C.--I hunch some of them typed with two-fingers, too.  A little girl was abducted (likely sexually abused--we didn't get THAT detail back then, either) and later found dead in the brush near the end of Polson Park. Believe they caught the guy. Happened in the summer.  

Next September, in an era of one-car families, kids--like me--walked to school and back every day.  So did my younger brother and sister.

And when we got into the (one) family car to go ""for a drive"" (people did that back then, too. Strange, eh?). Guess what?  No seatbelts.",0

"That's Ryan's plan. Replace Medicare with vouchers to purchase coverage from private insurers, and cover co-pays -- not enough to cover seniors' medical needs, and no provisions for rising costs of care. Couple this with cuts to Social Security, and seniors will be ""rewarded"" with poverty for their decades of work and contributions if the party of cruelty gets its way.

Speaking of Ryan, he called the horrific GOP bill his dream. Apparently, his dream is to increase Insurers current record profits with taxpayer supported subsidies, provide tax breaks for our nation's wealthiest, and work against the interests of middle-income Americans by reducing coverage at higher cost, and leave impoverished Americans without coverage.",0

Of course they will have to move to where the work is like the rest of us. But the government will direct the payments currently going to the chief directly to the families so they can relocate for the work they have chosen.

"I think if Paxton progressed like you'd expect a 1st round, 2nd year QB to progress, the job would have been his.  But that progression isn't very apparent yet, albeit it's only 1 week into training camp.

A month ago I'd have said odds were better of him being the starting QB.  Now I'm back to thinking it will be Trevor.  At least to start the season.  If he falters during the year, it's easier to swap to Paxton at that point than it would be the other way around.  Starting Paxton and then benching him for ineffectiveness almost ends his career with the Broncos.",0
