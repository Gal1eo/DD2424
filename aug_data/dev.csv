"Or is this that old Austrian canard where empirical evidence is not as important as whatever you imagine will happen because you think your imagination is logical ?
Everyone of your concerns are shown to be false by empirical evidence in hundreds of experiments over the past century. Even the very first one, done some 200 years, ago proved to be a roaring success - even though it's results got fraudulently altered by Malthus (he wrote the report without ever bothering to read the data it was supposedly based on - he just wrote what he imagined happened, and despite your dislike for him, his view of people was remarkably similar to yours).

You worry about people being willing to fund the undeserving. Yet all over the world - universal programs are more popular, more easy to defend and more politically resilient than means-tested programs - and cheaper too because you don't need a huge burocracy to do the means-testing. People like programs they benefit from themselves.",0

"Pres. Obama could have lead the way to more societal norm improvements than he did, by for example, filling the many currently-blocked federal judicial vacancies as well as numerous other actions he could have taken IF the radical-right, GOP majority congress wasn't dead-set on stopping his every move. (Likely to make him appear, to the casual observer, ineffective.) It took all of his energy getting through the few but tremendous improvements he managed to get through.

"Few people are recognizing the dangers. A new ideology has arisen that blames all the evils of the world on white men. Australian schools are implementing a widespread program of “feminist collective” clubs where children are taught that “white, male privilege” and “hegemonic masculinity” are the root of domestic violence. 

Domestic violence is not gendered and not confined to any specific race. All this nonsense is promoted by regressive liberalism / social justice warriors and 4th wave feminism. In Australia check out the degree of censorship and calls to ban the ""Red Pill"" documentary that was made by the US Film Director Cassie Jaye - who as originally being a feminist no longer wants her name to be associated with feminism.

It is this cult mentality that is doing significant harm to men - not only white men. In the West this discrimination has become institutionalised.  The article not only feeds into the radical feminist narrative, but also the white supremacist movements.",0

So, Ms. Taylor, as an employee of CTVBellGlobeMedia, which has received a number of negative decisions recently from the CRTC, are you implying that the decisions of the Commission prior to June can all be dismissed because the chair was ""a Stephen Harper appointee"" and hence in some way tainted?  Or might it be more relevant that M. Blais was a career public servant, and Mr. Scott a telecom executive and lobbyist, prior to their respective appointments?

Trump thanked Lebanese prime minister Hariri for Lebanon’s efforts in fighting extremist groups, including the political party Hezbollah.

“Hezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people and the entire region,” Trump said.

There’s only one problem: Hezbollah is in the Lebanese government.



Hariri only became prime minister following a 29-month political stalemate in Lebanon that only ended after Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, became president. 

Aoun named Hariri prime minister as part of a compromise deal of sorts, and while Hariri has an adversarial relationship with the organization, its members nonetheless have significant power within the government.

1. Few Canadians are politically informed and engaged, especially in-between elections. 
2. All Canadians had a chance to provide their input in-person or online for this process.

4. 70% of those who attended the town halls supported a form of proportoinal representation. Few spoke in favour of FPTP(despite what Monsef is trying to portray)

Now we're hearing Monsef waffling on the issue and talking about a lack of 'broad consensus'. The bottom line is that among those who care about politics in this country, the vast majority support a form of proportional representation. This is perhaps suprising for the Liberals and now they are trying to back pedal since a move to proportional representation will mean an end to their false majorities on less than 40% of the popular vote.

Answer: Nothing, because there were no humans then. There was no threat to humanity or property millions of years ago. We all know that there is no way to prevent climate. However, if there were a society like ours back then, scientists could probably have foreseen the upcoming disaster and prepared for it. Of course, there probably would have been deniers back then as there are today who may have destroyed any chance we might have had for survival.
We know that we can prevent much of the damage that climactic activities cause. I'm not saying we can build a wall around our nation anymore than we can build a wall all along the border with Mexico or Canada, but we can mitigate the effects of climate change if we want to.

For Duns Scotus, Jesus was the ‘image of the invisible God' who revealed to us a God's eternal suffering love for humanity, in an iconic form that we could not forget.

"A deserving original inductee in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Fats was the second giant of the genre to leave us this year, preceded by 90 year old Chuck Berry in March.

The only original giants now left from the roots of rock and roll are Little Richard, 85 in December but not active as a performer and Jerry Lee Lewis, 82 in September and still doing concerts including one on his birthday, September 29th, at the BB King Club in New York.  (Watch this concert on you tube before it is removed and you'll see The Killer can still bring it on that pumping piano albeit for shorter spells than in his incredible prime.

Hawaii residents do not complain bitterly about the tax they pay at retail stores, groceries etc.

I believe Trump campaigned on being a man of the people, intent on helping the little guy and he accused Clinton of being the candidate of Wall Street.

"The bottom line here is first that appearances count, and second that Canada, like most Christian-heritage countries, has nudity taboos that are emotional rather than rational. As far as I know, the ability to read minds does not exist; I cannot see into another person's mind to find out what gender they perceive themselves to be, but when they are naked I can see what gender they appear to be. That's the first point.

Second, Canada's most common nudity taboo is the taboo against being seen naked by any adult member of the opposite sex that you are not in an intimate or medical relationship with. The combination of ""appearances count"" and the nudity taboo means that most women will be distressed at finding themselves naked in the presence of an apparent male, especially if ""he"" is also naked.",0

Now, for something completely different, Your Leafs--hey!--win that tiebreaker for all those teams chasing them.  So their current 2-pt margin over Philly is essentially 3 pts.

Truth be told, Your Leafs have improved only a bit since mid-way through last season, their position in the standings a year ago early Jan, not that much worse than where they stand today.  At that point, Your Leafs went into full tank mode, icing an inferior lineup with the implicit purpose of losing.

And, good for them, it worked.  Job well done.  The fan base roared its approval, being used to losing for a decade, their thoughts being if you're going to lose, at least do it right.  High 5s all round.",0

Fortunately, the Eugene Mission extended their stay there for a couple of months so the weather will at least be better when they are forced to move.
The requirement that legal rest stops must be run by a non-profit organization keeps many people from being able to set up and run their own camps, and guarantees that there will be many homeless people who won't have legal places to stay.
Both the rest stops and the dusk to dawn sites require people to leave during the day. Neither of these programs alleviate the problem of homeless people not having places to exist during the day, so there will always be complaints about the number of them downtown, at the library, etc.",0

Wells, onshore and offshore, in the Cook Inlet have been completed in this manner for over a quarter of a century.  The depth of the stimulation is over 5000' below the deepest potable water horizon and these types of fractures typically extend less than a few feet from the wellbore.  The Beluga whale decline has been linked directly to poor subsistence hunting practices, not the oil and gas industry.

Sanders has stirred up masses of people who pose a threat to those privileges. His proposed policy changes could cut into the Democratic establishment’s entrenched interests.

Kiss snowy Alaska winters goodbye
 Author: Miranda Weiss   Updated: September 28, 2016   Published January 3, 2016
HOMER — I took last winter personally, the months of snowless dark. And I had none of my usual outlets for surviving — or thriving — in the cold. Local ski trails were grassy. Walking routes were glazed in ice. Without snow, I ran out of ways to coax my children outside so that we all wouldn't go crazy. I unfurled an old tarp across our steep, green backyard and sent them down it in sleds. That held their interest for 30 minutes.

I'd always bragged to folks Outside that in Alaska we enjoyed a ""reliable"" winter. But as they got buried in successive snowstorms on the Eastern Seaboard for the second year in a row, nothing seemed reliable about our winter. It wasn't winter at all. It was a punch to the gut.

Assisted suicide does not fit Hawaii
By Craig Nakatsuka, M.D.; Fernando Ona, M.D.; and Joy Yadao, R.N.
January 22, 2017

We don’t know why some who have an incurable disease recover, and others do not. We also don’t know why some of our loved ones may suddenly be taken away from us, while others continue on their healing journey for a long period.
We may not have answers to all of life’s questions, but we do know that imposing assisted suicide in Hawaii may have consequences.

Proponents of assisted suicide overlook the fact we live in a state in which culture and family play vitally important roles in our decision-making. They would like us to believe it is all about individual rights. They put themselves at the center of attention, proclaiming their right to die when they want, how they want, where they want. We do not think that way in Hawaii. We think about what is best for the family.

God made us to be serene, with a reconciled intellect, will, and set of emotions or passions.  They are not naturally reconciled.  We don't have perfect dominion over our faculties.  Takes effort, virtue, beginning again, help from God. 

When there is a fissure or discordance among these human faculties, there is unpeace with in us. We should not believe one thing..and say another.  We shouldn't believe something is sin and yet allow our selves to do it without consequence. 

If laws make something illegal..and there is no proportionate consequence to behavior as a result...there is introduced a gaping fissure and inconstancy in society, that works its way into a person.",0

What Ancientalso is referring to is how you name the person who recieves your TFSA upon your death.

Name the person (it this case it can only be a spouse or common law spouse) that recieves your TFSA as a 'Successor Holder'.  This will allow them to 'roll over' the TSFA into theirs regardless of the contribution room available and allow the money to continue to grow tax free.

""Protected left turns should not coincide with a WALK signal. Flashing yellow arrows are permissive lefts ....with a WALK where the driver must yield.

"Re: ""gender inequality and the structural barriers that female workers and business owners face across all three countries.""

Women's advocates insist employers everywhere pay women less than men for doing exactly the same work in the exact same occupations and careers.

 If the advocates know women are being paid less, working women know it, too. So where are the millions of lawsuits? If the women don't know it and the advocates do -- how did that happen? -- why haven't the advocates notified them? And why haven't they named the employers and helped the women sue? 

Why do these same advocates think employers would not hire only women if, as they say, employers get away with paying females less for the same work?

Fluoridation advocates have long claimed that the safety of fluoridation is beyond scientific debate.[6] However, according to the well-known toxicologist, Dr. John Doull, who chaired the National Academy of Science’s review on fluoride, the safety of fluoridation remains “unsettled” and “we have much less information than we should, considering how long it has been going on.”[7] In 2006, Doull’s committee at the NAS published an exhaustive 500-page review of fluoride’s toxicity.[8] The report concludes that fluoride is an “endocrine disruptor” and can affect many things in the body, including the bones, the brain, the thyroid gland, the pineal gland, and even blood sugar levels.[9]",0

"Why does the bible not count as evidence? Just because you have prejudice against the Bible does not make it untrue or invalid. 

Unfortunately, no amount of evidence will convince some skeptics that GOD exists and that the bible is true, hopefully, you are not one of them and if you are I really feel sorry for you and I pray that GOD will open your eyes before you pass away GOD willing.

Some of the most significant evidence is the use of the B.C./A.D. that is used worldwide to stipulate the past and the future. This quite significant for a person of unimportance who was so insignificant according to you.

The old testament has 2500 prophecies and 2000 of them have already been fulfilled including the birth death and resurrection of JESUS.

The Dead sea scroll also confirms that the old testament has stayed the same and that it has not been changed even being translated from Hebrew to English it has stayed the same and this is humanly impossible.",0

"The power grid is a wonder of modern technology, not an antiquated or fragile relic.  It evolved over decades as the most cost-effective way to deliver reliable, safe, affordable electric power to even the most remote rural customer.  The U.S. grid delivers 99.997% reliability at a cost about 1/3rd of what Europeans pay.  The way to go backwards from 21st century to third-world status is to close your nuke and coal and gas power plants and force migration to wind and solar, like the state of South Australia recently did.  Their cost of power increased 180% and they are now enduring frequent blackouts.  Making the U.S. military rely on spasmodic, fragile, weather-dependent, low-density, remote, land-gobbling power sources like wind and solar; or upon $50/gal biofuels, is a recipe for disaster.

"Businesses don't tend to move due to corporate tax rates until it gets pretty extreme (we've seen a few cases of this with companies leaving the U.S. in recent years).  However that doesn't address what the actual effect of higher corporate taxes would be.  There are really only 3 possibilities:

1. Higher prices.  Usually doesn't happen since competition from other Provinces and other countries means companies can't raise prices.

2. Lower payments to shareholders through lower dividends or reduced capital.  This does happen and means lower personal income tax revenue and, in the long term, fewer jobs due to lower capital investment.

3. Lower wages.  Since companies can't change the price of inputs or outputs and need to pay enough returns to get investment dollars they are left cutting the only thing they have control over: employee wages.

It's worth noting that, since Canada started cutting corporate taxes in 2000 median real employee wages have increased substantially.",0
"Sir, who has told gay people they are disordered? What is disordered is the same sex passion, not the person. Or do you want to reduce people to their passions and sexual appetites? 

The Church does not reduce people to a sexual attraction.  The person is fine--it is their passion/sexual appetite that is disordered.  So what? Many people have disordered passions, attractions and appetites.  Alcoholics have a disordered attraction towards alcohol.  A married person who is attracted to someone who isn't his or her wife has a disordered attraction, etc.  The key, sir, is to master our passions.  We are not animals. We can reason and think.  When our passions and appetites draw us to sinful or disordered behavior, we can choose not to engage in those actions--because we can think and reason.

Inform yourself before making wildly inaccurate statements like 'net neutrality not directly related to privacy'.

Looking ahead, there are still a number of areas in Syria that are not controlled by the government. However, those areas that are still in rebel/terrorist hands will surely see the writing on the wall. Aleppo was the main prize, and the Syrian government just retook it despite all-out resistance. So what hope does armed resistance have elsewhere? It's possible that some resistance groups will be amenable to peace, while the terrorist groups will likely retreat to Islamic State territory.

"I think you are right to some extent, terrencew. Fossil fuel consumption will drop off, one way or the other.

Your post, however, does not outline anything by which it will drop off to near zero. It will be relatively easy for India to use solar power to charge batteries for ground and sea transportation, but not for producing steel, or flying airplanes. Germany, the western nation with a goal in this regard, is looking at replacing something like 40% of its fossil fuel consumption with alternate, sustainable sources, if I am not mistaken.

One thing we will have to consider is how we are going to lead one another to willingly reduce energy consumption. For British Columbia that will probably be a challenge as, on one hand, they receive large numbers of refugees from east of the mountains and, on the other, undertake massive and hurried construction to deal with a rising sea level.

That is wrong. The bills of the state are owned by everybody who lives here, not just a targeted group of people.
I support a flat sales tax and a system of users fees where everyone pays the bills of the state. The more you buy, the more you pay. Under an income tax, those who paid no tax would not care what the bills of the state were and would not care about voting for politicians who showed restraint with spending taxpayer money.

"""The Cold War is indeed over, but it would be instructive to remember the role that Castro played in the struggle between - yes - good and evil. He turned his island over to his Soviet patrons. He was quite willing to have nuclear missiles, launched from Cuban soil, destroy American cities. He exported revolution to Central and South America. He abetted Libyan terrorism. He gave asylum to murderers. He posted troops in Africa.""

And the removal of parking on a section of York and Pt Grey needed to make the bikeway better was also rejected.

And is is also a myth that bike lanes on arterials are always controversial. Several have gone in with little fuss including Dunsmuir and sections of Smithe, Nelson, Cambie and Burrard.

The reality is that there is much more space on arterial streets to make them work for everyone including people cycling with protected bike lanes. Residential streets are often very narrow making it difficult safe high volume bike routes while still keeping parking and essential vehicle access.",0

Even using a conservative estimate of the risk, with a 20% down payment, on a $600k one bedroom condo, a landlord would need to make a profit of $1,000 each month (after building maintenance fees, unit maintenance, property taxes and mortgage interest) in order to justify becoming a landlord. Our distorted housing market has enabled landlords to derive a majority of their ROI from increases in property values, but that cannot last forever, and at some point large increases in rents will be needed replace this lost income. 

Basic economics says; if rents are capped at a level which does not keep up with a landlord costs, while still allowing a reasonable ROI, there will be no landlords.",0

"""Bicycles pollute wilderness areas... and damage minimalist trails that only feet should touch""

Eight years ago I helped lead Stop Rail Now with absolute conviction that bus rapid transit would be superior, and that is still true, except we are now stuck with that viaduct. So to my mind the question is how to make the best of a very bad situation.  Terminating at Middle and forcing transfer to bus has many problems -- people hate to transfer, especially descending from one mode to another down below.  Therefore the more effective solution is to bring rail down to street level, continuing at grade on North King Street into downtown, and turn around at Alapai. With that, downtown workers benefit, the urban core will be stimulated, and others can transfer to bus at Alapai.  Eventually, extension to Univ Ave on S Beretania/S King serves UH, as I explained above.",0

We can be reasonably certain of that based upon history and science alone, barring some cataclysmic event such as a Yellowstone eruption or nuclear war or asteroid impact.

In addition, Alaska needs to do the following: develop an equitable energy distribution system that would help all Alaskans remain viable and enable economic development to occur statewide; invest in a comprehensive statewide transportation system that will move people and material safely across the state to enhance economic activity; and develop a high speed robust broadband internet system that will increase economic activity, allow distance education delivery, and provide medical treatment using visual technology to treat illness in all parts of Alaska. 
Absent investment, Alaska will never achieve its potential.",0

“The answer is: By definition, private revelation is NOT the Word of God”.

The Church has acknowledged that the Word (Will) of God had been given to her, its actions confirm this, we have a picture in God’s House, with the words “Jesus I trust In thee” But the picture is not the one commanded by God, it is a worldly image of goodness, it pertains to the senses, and is made in man’s own image, it has nothing to do with Trust.
The present Divine Mercy Image is a self-serving IMAGE of Clericalism, definition of CLERICALISM: a policy of maintaining or increasing the power of a religious hierarchy.
 
The original picture by Sister Faustina in its brokenness relates to spiritual beauty (goodness) it pertains to humility. 

“The pure (humble) in heart shall see God”

"Trump is not targeting the Hawaii middle class. The tax reform proposal is Nationwide to provide and a tax break for all, except those of those with high income levels.  By the way, I wish we stop using ""rich"", let's just use income levels.  Hence, no targeting, it is to address the needs of the Nation.  However, Hawaii and those states that are taxing their residents in excess (i.e. Hawaii, CA, NY, etc.) may lose the state and county tax deduction.  However, the ~ doubling up of the standard deduction may be best vs. itemizing (local tax).  The tax bracket change and reform may have the added benefit to push the politicians to cut down / manage the size of government (tax) and manage government spending (tax)...something I believe the middle class would appreciate.

"There quite obviously had to be something drastically wrong under Obama earlier and having so many Americans thumbing their noses at the media's darling Clinton who was an even worse choice than Trump.

Maybe the media should have done the responsible thing and attacked Clinton with the same venom during the primaries when she was supplied the debate questions from CNN's Donna Brazile, the Democratic party itself undermining the Sanders nomination campaign, and lack of response when Democrats were found to be organizing paid infiltrators to attack Republicans at their rallies with open violence.

Americans unfortunately had two extremely bad candidates to choose from. Both parties were laced with corruption and underhanded dealings so don't give the illusion there wasn't something inherently wrong before.

Blame both parties and the media for creating all this mess that the voters recognized.

I'm sure both parties will recognize how they failed Americans.

"Chrizmart, I don't know how aware you are of the situation in Northern Ireland. I have never in my life experienced such overt homophobia. It was truly vicious. There was a Thursday night talk show televised each week from Belfast. The subject matter was often political and the panellists would be either unionist or nationalist politicians.

I saw the programme twice when it concerned matters surrounding homosexuality. I was utterly astonished! Unionist members of the audience at times were feral. The hatred of gay people was scary. 

It was a collection of Protestant fundamentalists, a macho vulgar culture, and plain knuckledraggers. 15000 is nothing in terms of the US, but it is serious, concentrated hatred in a small part of the world.

As an aside, there is a historical relationship between N. Ireland and early white settlers in the Appalachian mountains. 

Thankfully Ireland voted for gay rights at the recent referendum. I hope the North improves.",0
